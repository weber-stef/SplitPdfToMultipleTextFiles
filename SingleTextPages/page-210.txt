TOGETHER

I do want no trouble here, need no one to make me fear,
'want a life without much tears, I am young just once.
Too many fools'n'too silly rules, too many brains that are not used.

Agree, because they are forced to.
Believe in those simple rules they got,
following without thinking.

Do stay calm in any way, don't you ever think astray.
They'll hold you down anyway to be safe above.

Refrain:
We can just fight them down together.
We can tear down their crown together.
