TAKE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR HANDS

If you just sit around, you'll stay hungry baby.
You got to search the one to share your life.
You got to get to know, what your yearning's all about.
You got to find out, what you want to find out.

Bridge:
No, it ain't that easy to begin
to take your life in your hands.

You don't need a leader to survive in this cruel world.
You just got to do, what you want to do.
You don't need to hide your trouble deep in your heart, baby.
Just cry it out, try to push it down.

Bridge:
Then it could be easy to begin to take your life in your hands.

Refrain:
You say, you had the wrong relation, you say, he really pushed you down and you
don't want to be cheated one more time.
Babe I really understand you, I think, I think I know the feeling well,
but he ain't the whole world, so won't you give it one more try.

If you just talk to yourself no one can help you change your mind.
You'll stay helpless with no hope on a change.
You got to do the first step, got to start the fire.
It's easy if you just make up your mind.
You will feel better in the end
Just take your life in your hands.

Refrain

Bridge:
C'mon open up your mind, open up your heart,
try to turn the tables, try to have a start.
Open up your window, open up your door,
Don't you forget what your life is for.
Take your life in your hands! Try to do it your own way!
Just make up your troubled mind.

Take your life in your own hands
