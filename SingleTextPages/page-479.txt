I WANNA KISS YOU

There is a world I‘d like to see with you
There is a power hitting you and me
As if I knew you from before
As if I was close to a shore

Bridge:
I want you to sit on my lap,
your arms around my neck

Bridge 2:
Get over here, move on with me
get off with me, talk to me
time is precious and there is so much to see
Lets pretend it is forevermore

Bridge:
Because when I first saw you, it started
Well I had been warned
about your beautiful eyes
your beautiful lips,
come closer, much closer

Bridge 2

Bridge 3:
What‘s the difference? What‘s the consequence?
Let‘s find out what we have got

Refrain:
I wanna kiss you, kiss you. I wanna find out, what we got.
As if you touched me, touched me, while I was touching next to none.
Just like I knew you, knew you, as if I knew you from before.
I wanna kiss you, kiss you. I feel so clumsy around you.

Bridge 3:
I see you by my side.
