YOUR EYES

Looking in your eyes, I still feel lonely after all this time
I still feel the hurting when watching you just going on by.
Help me now, hold my hand, babe.
Hold me now, why don't you listen
It seems, I can't get up again on my own.

Looking in your eyes, I still feel so lonely.
So don't you look into my eyes
I feel so lonely, when watching you just walking on by.
Walk by my side, babe, stay here by me,
walk by my side why don't you listen.
I can't get up on my toes again.

Refrain
I need you to be my friend,
I need you to understand me, babe.
I need you to hold my hand,
I need you to be a friend of mine.
Even though I don't even say it,
I'm still in love with you,
So don't you leave me alone, now.

Looking in you eyes, I still feel lonely, after all this time,
I still feel the hurting when looking at you just walking on by
deep inside my heart, inside my brain, inside my heart
I can't let you go, I just can't lose all contact.
I just can't let you go.

Refrain
You're my sweetheart.
