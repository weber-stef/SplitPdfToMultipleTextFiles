TAKE A CHANCE

Baby, won't you stay this night by my side,
won't you make my dreams come true,
Don't you want us to do something?
Baby won't you stay a night in my warm bed,
are you headed out, I'm headed out,
aren't you headed out for satisfaction?

Bridge:
You've got my whole life in your hands, why not continue our romance?
It's pleasure just to take a chance. I'm nearly sure, you'll like it.

Baby, let's make this night one to remember;
won't you let me show my love?
Babe, I'd really like to touch you.
And Girl, oh won't you come a little closer,
put your hands on my hot body
Don't slow down now, my sweet dear.

Refrain:
You've got my whole love in your hands; your body covers me again.
And I do hope, this never ends, because I love this my sweet baby.

And she says, she whispers in my ear softly:

“Baby, I love to touch your back so very much,
love to hear you breath and touch your neck
And I'd love you to come closer.
Oh, Babe, why won't you make your fingers touch me,
won't you make me vibrate slowly?
I'm headed out for you yet.”

And as she steps into my bed,
and as we smile, for we are glad,
as our bodies start to sweat,
as we start to move,
we're switching on a different light
and slowly we start to get wild,
holding each other as if we were tied,
I know that sex means love to us.
