GETTING DOWN

Getting out of trouble 'n' straight back into,
Hiding away from things U don't want to be true.
You're trying to rip out the dangerous arrow made of doubt
But it's a long way to the top.
Refrain:
And it is leading you down.
You watch your mirror's eyes boy, what do they think 'bout you
Some may say it's so easy but it's you to know that just ain't true.
There ain't no simple truth no matter what method you use
Can't just hold on to what you got.
Refrain:
'Cause that would just lead you down.
Bridge:
Trying to get something to hold on to, trying to keep memories alive
It seems that one and one isn't always two,
It seems it's not as simple as that.
The problem is sometimes it's too many options
so each decision could be the worst.
The problem is sometimes you just feel too happy,
while you're afraid this bubble might burst.
Refrain:
And so you're getting on down.
