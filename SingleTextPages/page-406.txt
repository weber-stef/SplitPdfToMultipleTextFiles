INSIDE THE VOID

Lightning flashes, sky is black,
No more time to run away
Your name is Nobody and you live inside the void.

Much too fast to get a grip
much too big to see it all
Your life seems unreal
and you live inside the void.

Nothing to hold on to
and there's no one to know better
You search your way stumbling
as you move into the void.
Nothing here but giant walls
just getting bigger by the hour.

Refrain:
VITATECH – Open up your eyes
VITATECH – Your path is your aim.

Bridge:
In a dream you saw a different world.
In which only you really mattered.
didn't know where you were coming from.
You just felt happy.

But you live inside the void
you live inside the void
