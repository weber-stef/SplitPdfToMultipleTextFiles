ONLY

2 o'clock midnight and you cannot sleep,
Cause she's not here with you.
And inside your dreams it's all been different
She still belonged to you.
Just shut your eyes tight
Hold on to what you see
Everything here is yours..
You stand or you fall, can't explain it at all
This life is only about you.
Things they might disappear but to you they are here
It's forever.
It all belongs to you, every “we” every “you”
This life is only about you.
Things they might disappear but to you there still here
It's forever.
12 o'clock midday and you are clueless
You don't know, what will be.
Turning in circles your life goes nowhere
You don't know, what you want
What you want, what you want..
