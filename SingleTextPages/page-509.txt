ELENA NUMAN (SOMEWHERE SOMEWHEN)

I am drifting out to sea I am back aboard the boat
all by myself and no light to be seen.
I know where I've been coming from
but I don't know where I will go
You're outta here
Further on just straight ahead and noone knows the way.
Further on just straight ahead.
Again it did not work out well
And everybody tells me the same
about me.
Refrain:
Somewhere somewhen I will find somebody
It won't be you and me
Somewhere somewhen I will find somebody
It just won't be you and me
further out to the sea where I've never been.
there must be so much, that I wanna see, that I wanna feel too
further out to the open sea, there is wind and then there is me
Ther must be someone I was ment to find, made for me
Well, I can understand I have no masterplan at hand,
I don't know where it's gonna end or it will lead me to ..
