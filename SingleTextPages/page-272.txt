BUBBLES                                              1992
                                                   (07.02.)
Bridge:
Being born, growing up,
getting downed until you're dying.
Being pushed, standing up,
dreams that burst like bubbles.

Sitting at the subway station,
waiting for the next train.
Looking at the advertisement
with that grinning face.
Standing up, walking to the
edge of the platform,
staring at the rails ..

Bridge

Bridge II:
The shriek of the breaks seem to fill up the hall
until the wheels stop turning.
waves of moving corpses, with indistinct voices.
Tourists that speed past the pictures of life.

Refrain:
Life - Is it worth all the things we do?
Is it a lie or is it true?
Does it last as we fade?
Dreams - Is it possible they come true?
Just believers or simply fools?
Never too late?

Waiting for another train,
this hasn't been the right one.
Wrong place, wrong time?
