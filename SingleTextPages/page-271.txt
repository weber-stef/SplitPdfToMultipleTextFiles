NO COMPROMISE

Switch on the TV - set and look at them
beautiful and happy, cause they never ever seem to lose a thing
Success is sexy, love is money, ignorance rules the only way to live.

Bridge:
They cheat. They lie to you,
Calculating every thing you going to do.
It's you to listen now,
They won't tell you why,
but they will show you how.

Refrain:
Either giving up full of bitterness,
or a sarcastic winner in this mess.
There must be something in between.
No compromise!

Walking out your door, watching moving corps,
Skeletons with flesh and skin on them.
There must be something that is moving this,
Some place that I have never been to.

Bridge, Refrain

Bridge 2 :
Don't know why I'd tell you,
cause I do not even trust you,
I cannot look into your eyes.

So I talk to myself
even though I know it won't help,
because I cannot find out why.

Don't you try to show me,
cause you do not even know me,
even I got no clue.

Should it be me rearranging, changing,
can you tell me what is true?!
