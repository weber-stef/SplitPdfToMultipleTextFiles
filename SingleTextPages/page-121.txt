JACKIE

She not just someone, she is Jacki.

Jacki was his girlfriend before he left the town,
where he had lived ever since he was five years old.
She dedicated him a part of her life
and maybe she loved him just a little too much.

One day he had to leave her for he had to start to travel.
He had to start to run around from town to town.
But he still remembers the beautiful time they spent together,
the beautiful time with Jacki.

Refrain:
"My friend is an artist!", she once said
as the others just started to laugh.
She was a brave girl who stood right by his side,
every time he needed someone to love,
..She was Jacki.

Jacki was the first girl, that lay down by his side,
and they had a lot of fun then.
He still remembers, even when she slept there was a smile on her face.
Jacki, she had blond hair and her eyes were greenish
and they looked a little roguish, even in bed.
Jacki, she looked pretty as she lay asleep and naked
and her heart was always beating fast, so fast.

Refrain:
â€œYou shall be my only lover." she once said, but she just made him sad,
for he knew that it might not be true and it was making him mad,
 For she was not just anyone, she wasn't someone you forget,
No, she wasn't anyone, she wasn't someone you forget,
she was his Jackie.

Now he again is in his hometown, sitting at the bus stop.
Having in his hands a note from Jacki:
"I would like to see you some day, it would be nice if you'd arrange it,
I'm still living in the same old house. "
