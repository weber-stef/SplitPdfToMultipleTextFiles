VITATECH

It's been a lot of time it's been lots of experiences
It's been way up high it's been too far down, down, down.
No one ever told us, it would be that different in the end.
Though sometimes just another replay.
Avoid foreseeing things, they'll happen too soon.
just touch something lifeless, just bark at the moon.
I'll maybe just fuck you, but who of us cares?!
We'll transpire our yearning, we won't see no tears.
Bridge:
Love is something precious, nothing to be touched with dirty hands.
trust is somehow unreal and it's easy to be crushed.
Lust is something plain, it is easy to feel it, seems almost innocent
So you just better take it easy.
Refrain:
Vitatech - Give me something to wake up.
Vitatech - Give me something.
