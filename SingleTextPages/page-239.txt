SIGNS

What is going on inside your head?
What kind of tthoughts appear?
Can you tell me what it is you fear?
Or's there just indifference?

Refrain:
Signs are changing, time is fleeting.
You can't stop the process.
All those minutes, all those memories
What do you want to recall?

Apathetic kind of feeling and intoxicated eyes
I just cannot stop this feeling
but I cannot close this book,
Too many pictures I just cannot stop
In a film much too absurd.
