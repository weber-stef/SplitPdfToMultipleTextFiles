DIFFERENT

I'm bored of running 'round,
but in the meantime I'm waiting
for something to arrive.
I need something different.

'Just can't stop running,
still I'm stumbling on through this weird world.
Yet something has to change.
I need something different,

different than this.

Bridge:
Yet I still run on, no matter just which direction,
or what I'm going to find.
Yet I still do search for something,
that I don't know yet to enter my mind.

Refrain:
Won't you tell me, just why
it should be me to fight a weird life long?
Won't you tell me, just why
it should be me to fight?
