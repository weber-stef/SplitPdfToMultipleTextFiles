PHONE NUMBERS

I saw the phone number of Jesus
in the subway today
but God's a very busy man
and my phone bill is much too high

I used to write down all my feelings,
used to carve them in words
It seems that saved me lots of money
still right now I'd rather talk

Refrain:
God listens,
It seems God listens
to anybody but me
God listens,
It seems just listens
at least he is not speaking to me.

I don't believe he is waiting
on a telephone line
I don‘t have to see,
what I have right here on my mind.
