FROM DUST TO GLORY

Whatever may rise from dust to glory
might as well turn into a nightmare, get you down.
A power to hold you, words to betray you
an attitude to hold your head down, push you down.

Refrain:
Lights may burn a dark night to a misty dawn.
Tables turn, suddenly your chances are gone.
No compromise! Don't you just pretend, it's alright.
Shadows fall depending on the shine of the light.

No force or possibility, no holy vow allows you
to make me crawl, or the other way round.
It's obvious, you won't change a thing,
if you're not willed to think about it
to finally decide

Refrain

Bridge:
You've got to accept, you're the one to find out.
what you're living for, what your life is about.
There should be no one, doing the judging for you.
For this is the thing, we're created to do.

From dust to glory.
