WORLD

You now look like someone pleased
with what is happening to you.
I've just heard about you being heard everywhere,
It's your mother that has told me
you shout out what you want.
It's the look of you that makes me agree.
Now soon you will be older
and you will recognize
how much life there is that does surround you.
And you'd love to follow those lights
that you see in the dark,
until finally one day you do.
Refrain:
There's a million of those moments that pass
before your eyes.
Yet there's lots of things
that you'll get to know.
' Just depends on how your spirit
builds up during time's run,
It's dependent on the look of your eyes
watching the world.
