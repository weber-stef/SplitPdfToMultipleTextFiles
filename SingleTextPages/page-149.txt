HUMAN THINKING

When someone plays a joke on you, joke on you
without a reason, just for having fun.
And you're thinking to yourself, to yourself that he's not worth the pain.
The moment that you're thinking of vengeance,
the moment that you're planning your revenge,
The moment that you think you're different, a better kind,
then you're even worse.
Bridge:
There's a fault in human thinking, that leads you to ignore the harm
of trying to join hands with a power, that helps you to keep others calm.
Refrain:
But to act in a matter as your conscience directs, is very hard to do.
It's easier to follow leaders that differentiate for you
and tell you you are right in thinking just in black and white.
And even if you're intellectual, cynical, you can't avoid to change your attitude.
And you will start to compromise, close your eyes, you just won't want to see
that your ideas do get radical, funeral,
you'll just ignore it and you will keep calm.
You'll feel that these tthoughts are coming up inside your mind,
can't keep safe from this harm.
