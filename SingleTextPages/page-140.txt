GOODBYE

Do you know this is the last time,
do you realize, we have to part now?
It makes me think back on the time gone by,
causes an aching deep inside my heart.
It will never be the same again
and it won't even be that amazing
to go on now.
It was fun. It was easy. It was surprising,

but now
Refrain:
Goodbye - We got to say goodbye
The old times have gone by
and I will always remember, goodbye!

We were working hard all that time,
but we received a lot from you then.
We drank a lot and we had lot's of fun.
We had a smoke from time to time.
It will never be the same again,
nobody was as amazing as you.

We had fun. That was easy. You were surprising.

Refrain

Goodbye!
