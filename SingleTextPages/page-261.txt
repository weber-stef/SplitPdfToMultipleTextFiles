VIEW

Seems I've been walking for ages
through a world without any light.
It is cold and it's damp
and it's creeping inside.
Just a question of what goes on
behind your closed eyes.
Like an enemy we can't grab,
we stopped wondering why.

Refrain:
Is it all just because of our view of things?

Guy's been walking to places,
that seemed like whole worlds themselves.
Through light and through darkness,
through time and through space.
In search of something he doesn't know
and places he's never seen.
There's just a picture inside his head,
the only thing that remains.

Refrain

Bridge:
Tossing and turning and animalizing,
being happy and sad at the same time.
Walking in darkness until you see light,
that makes your eyes burn so again
you can't see anything.
