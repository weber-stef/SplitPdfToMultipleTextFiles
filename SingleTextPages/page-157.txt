THE RIGHT THING

Sometimes silence seams to tell me something anyway.
Sometimes I fight against real big forces, where there is only me.

A dawn's red light in a violet fog, reflected in the water
of a cold, dark sea is awakening me.
I get up on my feet and start walking slowly down to the surf
to see if it's rising.

Refrain:
There's always something, that you can't pretend.
Sometimes things happenâ€ž you don't understand.
Things, you can't influence, nor change or do end.
So just follow your heart's calls and hope, you do the right thing anyway.

The wind gets stronger and the tide is rising.
Sea gulls scream unusually hoarse,
so full of force.
And me, stepping right in the muddy, cold water, till it reaches my eyes,
I still do look for you.

Refrain

Bridge:
Anyway, I am still wondering about little hints,
but I'm not yet sure, what they do mean.
Sometimes silence seams to tell me something anyway.
And I feel, as if I fell down or drowned in the sea,
drowning in the sea.
