IS THERE STILL TIME

Surrounded by powers, we cannot see through,
condemned to be a little gear wheel,
an innocent part of a larger design,
whose existence you always can feel,
You'd rather start running, but you'd never get out,
the system will always be there.
For it has grown bigger in all these gone years
and. it doesn't need to be fair, oh

Refrain:
Is there still time to change our minds?
Is there still time to fight it all down, down, down, down?

It's feet are of iron, but soiled with blood,
but it's hands are so beautifully clean.
It makes you get cruel, gets you in the mud,
but it never really is to be seen.
Its' eyes are around you and looking in yours,
but you still can please them as well,
as long as you function, the way you're to do.
Just do forget what you felt..

Refrain
