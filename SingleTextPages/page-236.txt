EVOLUTION

They took brain cells of a baby
put them in glass and made them divide
They multiply the selected
whose quiet mothers are made out of glass

Fascination rules the student,
mesmerized by the professor's look
Evolution through a man's hands,
by a man's judging brain.

Refrain:
A perfect look they have
and simple minds.
- Seem to be born to be glad.

They're not that complex, so it is easy
to find a fitting idea for each one.
Same are born to work, some are born to rule
and some to fight for the sake of the new Gods.

For the first time it is perfect.
There is no blemish to sign the new breeds.
There'll be no riots, this world is ceaseless
if you just create a calm temperament.

Refrain

Bridge:
They may change the order of the chromosomes
til the creature fits in with the idea.
Bowing its head before the altars of
those new Gods.
