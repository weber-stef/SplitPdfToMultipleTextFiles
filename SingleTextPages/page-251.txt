INVOLVED

Put all this stuff away let's get out of this.
I'm getting involved in it, not knowing what it is.
I'd like to close my eyes just be left alone.
Nothing to harm me, nothing ought to be done.
At least I know I'm not to influence this.
'Don't even know about the thing that I miss.
I'd like to close my eyes to make it all fade.
'Need something to tear me out before it's too late
Refrain:
I still remember those different days.
Nothing too strange or too far away.
'Seems everything changes lately.
'Seems everybody gets old.
I'm running outside to rest underneath stars.
understand my own presence between future and past.
Much too dark, not a single light.
Not a hope in sight.
Something's looking out for me.
Yet I cannot touch it and thus I cannot flee.
I'm moving backwards trying to run away.
Waiting for an explosion that may come any day now.
