THE HEADDANCE

Could this be a competition of a different kind?
Could it be true, if it happened, I went out of my mind?
Everything changes, all around me there are different vibrations.
Refrain:
Changes, not easy to be handled.
The city makes a man run, he has no place to rest,
When the apathy appears, while you are still in quest
for the place to be you, what do you want to do now?
