LOOK IN

Maybe true I got used to, surely true I got old.
'Hope it's not that I'm boring, you will tell me the truth.
Yet this life needs no turn - around and I know what I do.
And I'm happy it's like it is, including you.
Refrain:
And I want to be free,
while I want you to be around.
Yes I want to be free while
I want you to be around.
And I'd like to have children, while I am still a child.
Looking into mine, while into your eyes.
But, you know, I'm still running, looking out I look in.
I got two ideas on my mind, I hope you understand.
