CORE OF THE IDIOT

Nowhere to go, seems time to quit
but there is something inside you
Never give up
No time to rest, no place to be
yet there is some space inside of here,
must be that soul
Refrain:
I dont give up, its the core of the idiot, the place that i might be
whenever you see me disintegrate
Do I live up to what I expected, and what was expected since?
I am looking different and differently
Nowhere to go; are these wrong directions?
You never can plan out the way it will go in the end
Heart over mind I guess that is how my mind works
Itâ€˜s a hallenging behaviour at times
