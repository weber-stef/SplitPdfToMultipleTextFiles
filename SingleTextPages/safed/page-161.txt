YOU DON'T RUN AWAY

Sometimes, in times of trouble, when you don't see no way out,
but you got to get away, got to get away, got to get away,
when you just don't know, what to do your mind reminds you:

Bridge:
Don't you, don't you run away, just run away,
you can't always be dreaming.

Refrain:
Of getting high above it all,
of leaving for love's tender call,
more than you can explain.
Of getting all, that you desire,
being loved by someone, you admire
and never losing touch.

Of drifting on, further away,
never getting out your way,
and never getting cruel?
Of living in a lively world,
far beyond any trace of hate
and never getting cool too soon.

So, whenever you are tired of running on empty, just getting low,
don't turn around, just look straight ahead on your aim,
never giving up quietly.

Bridge:
You don't have to run away, don't run away,
but you can go on dreaming.
Do not, do not run away,
just run away, try to realize your dreams.
