A CRUEL LAND

As the night fell down on the city,
he was looking through his window and he noticed, he was lonely.
There neither was no love, nor any pity.
He could break down and cry, but nobody would care.

He saw somebody walking down the wet streets,
passing the cage, he lived in, with those neon lights.
He could run out to tell that someone, he would need him,
but he was sure as hell, he wouldn't understand.

Refrain:
It was a cruel land, he was living in.
He could be sure, that nobody would care.
Was he a fool, or just a living man, was it the truth, that he didn't understand.
It was a cruel land. It was a cruel land, he lived in.

He walked down the dirty staircase,
just to get out and feel the wind on his face.
Maybe someone existed, who would meet him
and who'd take him away to another place.
He ran down the blocks and pushed his way through main street,
but nobody noticed him, cause they all walked too fast.

He ran faster, blinded by the lights of cars on main street,
tilll suddenly it crashed and he fell down.

Refrain

If there is still hope left on a better world,
where people live beyond all hate.
Not ruled by Gods, or any other thing,
Let's start to look for it.
