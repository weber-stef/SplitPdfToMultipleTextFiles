GRAVITY

Hey buddy you look a little strange , better go check your hair
I think we caught you lying Mister here
Hold on to your twisted truth, but do it somewehere else
This word belongs to us - the people who dare

Refrain:
You got a bad vibe all over you
and all the things that you got
just like a bad dream out of the dark
Why can't you just disappear

Hey buddy in the end you will be on your own
there's boundaries to madness you will be shown
Up the stairs to a higher room, while the basement disappears
Must be a window somewhere to clean the air

Bridge:
Greedy eyes look at this world
A one man nation under what god
Compliant servants lick up your boots
Remember gravity
Another big mouth on planet earth
sole purpose to help himself
Yet what goes up must come down
You'll be running in circles,
not knowin' what to do.

There's nothing good in the things you do
you won't prevail in the end
no staying power in twisted truth
something you'll never understand
You got a bad vibe all over you
and all the things that you got
just like a bad dream out of the dark
Why can't you just disappear
