KEEPING IN LINE

It got me so confused
your letter really reached me here.
Telling me what happens home,
a story of pain and fear.
It hit me awfully wrong,
it got me awfully wrong.
'Feels like another cut in my heart,
telling me where I belong,

Refrain:
But I am keeping in line,
I fear, I lose my mind.
I am out of time this time.

Shells come down too fast to be faster
and bullets fill the air.
Your tears mix with the dust in your face
and with the crime, that you share.
You're forced to kill the unknown man,
get killed if you're caught running away.
It feels so awfully wrong.
Your fear's so awfully strong.

Refrain

Bridge:
Late at night, I watch the stars
looking for signs up there.
telling me if you are safe
whatâ€˜s going on, while I am here.
