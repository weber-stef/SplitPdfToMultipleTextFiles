SEX AND INNOCENCE

Don't like to be the one to lose,
not getting, what I ' d like to choose
being torn into the blues,
just 'cause I fell in love again.
Though it might be a real chance,
to fall into a love's sweet trance,
could even be the one romance,
I'm always looking for.

Bridge:
It gets me out of times, when feelings were pale.
It lifts me up again, but it might as well just
Throw me down!

Refrain:
But as she turns around to me, just as she licks her lips,
while she looks right into my eyes, I'm all out of my wits.
Yet as she's walking on towards me that sexy innocence,
that is reflected in her smile doesn't leave me any chance
not to get weak.

Girls used to be that known to me,
That I would rather set them free,
than turn around and follow them,
to once more play the clown.
Yet still I don't know, what to do,
Not even, how I'm getting through.
Don't like to behave like a fool
still it affects me.

Bridge

Refrain:
But as I'm watching, how she walks, my brain seems to explode.
And as my hands do touch her skin, it's simply overload.
I love the way, that she behaves, whenever she plays games.
The feeling, I got holding her nearly drives me insane
and out of my head.
