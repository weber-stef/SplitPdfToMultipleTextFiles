HEAVEN OPENS UP

I think, everything you've got
could be something thrilling to me,
could be a thing I'd like to get into,
could be pleasant to me.
Babe, I'd like to get closer,
I'd like to get straight on.
When I get in touch with you, babe,
I guess heaven will open up.

Refrain:
There's a heat in my head,
I think, I'm close to losing control.
Want my hands to touch your skin,
want to get in touch with you,
C'mon girl, let's get up and down,
let's move girl.
