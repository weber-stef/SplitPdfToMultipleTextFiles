EVERYTHING TURNS ROUND THE GIRL

She looks pretty as she's lying there, as she lies right by your side.
And although you look into her eyes, you can't see her through.
It can be rough, she can be really strong,
sometimes you don't know, what to do.
She's a child and she's a woman, that you can't resist.

Bridge:
And as she turns around and you look into her eyes,
As you study her behaviour you realize

Refrain:
Everything turns round the girl
and you can't resist.
Everything turns round the girl
it's your life, you risk.
Everything turns round the girl
And you wonder, how long you can stay independent.

As you began to share her life, she started to develop her own style.
You saw her changing from day to day, she was growing up.
And now you see how everyone desires, what you think is just your right
You do hate these boys, but on the other hand,
you can't avoid to understand them.
