STRAIGHT AT YOU

(Tambourine)
'Try to recall the landscape, but it just flashes by,
Oh God, give me a rest.
'Cause I need to find out, what the question's about
and what it is that lasts.
Bridge:
When I wake up tomorrow, no matter where I might be
I won't look through the same eyes, so who is it I'll be
So when you touch me, we make love, tell me what do you see
I got my eyes straight at you.
You got to know me with that weary heart of mine,
so you can't know who I am
Still I feel better, now I got you on my mind
Even if you'd just pretend.
Refrain:
I'll go out to be around, as the sun goes up.
I'll be gone, but back I'll come,
if you let me come to you, baby, baby, baby.
