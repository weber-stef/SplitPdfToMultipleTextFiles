A VERY SERIOUS THING

How do you think about it lately?
Well, if you do want an impression of the life,
that I live, want to know my daily life and all its circumstances,
How do I think about it lately?,
A short answer would just not be enough.
How do you think about it lately?
Life is a very serious thing, that I do still laugh about.
Very quietly, I admit, it's no thing to be shouted out.
It is a question of humour. I do have one in exciting black.
Refrain:
And honey, if you do want more details about my work,
the dreams I sell,
I'd like to point out, that It's Heaven and Hell.
How do you think about this lately? How you do think about it lately?
was what I wanted to know
and it wasn't your self-pity, that I wanted you to show.
One's not that interested in your desires, but in what you earn.
How shall I think about that lately? What kind of drinks do you prefer,
do you take other drugs too? When did you realize
music was what you wanted to do, and How much money do you have
For these are the things that count.
Refrain
