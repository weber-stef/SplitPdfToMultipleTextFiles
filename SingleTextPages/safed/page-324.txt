LIFE'S WASTE

Love me or hate me, but let it be true,
make me feel again.
Bridge:
Time's precious, time's waste -
Depends on how you look at it.
Life's precious, Life's waste -
depends on you.
Many a thing I've seen in life,
I've looked from different angles,
but whenever what I fear becomes real,
it still knocks me off my feet.
Bridge
Turn to the right and I turn to the left,
but I just can't find the one way.
Don't let all this life's experience make up a final defeat.
