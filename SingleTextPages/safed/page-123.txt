I NEED SOME TIME

Baby, don't you know, how much it takes to take it not too hard
Just to go on by, without ever asking why.
Baby, I don't care if the sun goes up, or if it's raining, for I am alone.
It feels like I was lost, feels like I would never succeed.
Refrain:
I need some time to forget you now, Need some time to go by.
You know a whole world is changing now.
I'm walking down the road in the pouring rain,
that I don't even recognize
It doesn't matter now, it doesn't matter anyhow.
Me I need to forget you to go on by, to live all on my own.
I know, the time has come and I can't even run away.
Refrain
