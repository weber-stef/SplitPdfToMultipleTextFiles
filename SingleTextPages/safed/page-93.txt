LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE

He was a man in the shadow and lonely since years,
with nothing belonging to him.
Haunted in a mad world by memories of the past,
when he had still something to win.

She was a girl getting tired searching for ways.
Never heard an answer for years.
So she began to need no one, living on her own,
always surrounded by her fears.

Refrain:
There had to be something else, there had to be something more.
They were searching for what life's about, looking for someone, they could live for.

One day they met by chance on the cold streets at night.
The same frightened look was in their eyes.
They began talking, they had nothing to loose.
It seamed there would be no one in their life.

But when he heard her talking he seamed to understand,
'cause he himself was lonely too.
And as she looked at him, while he opened up his mind,
She did not know just what to do.

Refrain:
They were looking for something else.
They needed to find something more.
They were searching for somebody new.
Looking for something, they could live for.
There has to be something else.
There has to be.
