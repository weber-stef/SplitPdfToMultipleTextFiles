DAY MMIX

Some days with just opened eyes I dig for deeper looks inside
I try to find somebody I've been.
My memory's walk starts far away in a place in time where I could state
I'd exactly know what I'm all about.
Memory's walk starts far away - a place and time where I could state
I'd exactly know what I'm all about, well you wouldn't see a shade of a doubt
Where am I now?

I was in love with bitterness, the artist's love for his life's mess
Time should never break my heart's will

And when you think your special day didn't come and time faded away
the picture in your mirror looks strange,
somehow you just don't feel the same

Refrain:
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

the artist's love for his life's mess
Time should never break my heart's will
You keep revolving, every day
around a center you can't see
the person in your mirror gets strange,

Day in, day out you're killing it,
Day in, day out you're killing this,
day in day out you're killing your dream
Yet somehow it feels all the same to you

Where am I now?
