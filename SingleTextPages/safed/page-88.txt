NOW                                              1983


Now - the look in your eyes seams so strange.
I certainly know something's changed.
The things have to be rearranged.
But I don't know how.

We had much closer times before.
I don't really know you any more.
I don't know what you're looking for.
And what you want to find.

Refrain:
You say: The good times seem to be over.
There's nothing left to talk about.
We can't go on with our backs to the wall.
We both are counted out.

If we both do not know what to do,
And we both don't believe that it's true,
If we don't realise what we do,
Nothing will change.

Why does it always end up like this?
I believe a solution exists,
If somebody really resists
A world without questions.

Refrain

We got to search a way to go on.
Find a place to which we belong.
What I feel for you is still strong.
And I don't want to loose you.

Now believe me, please and don't cry.
We got time tilll the day that we die.
There will be no pain and no lies.
And we really can make it.

Refrain:
Don't you say...
