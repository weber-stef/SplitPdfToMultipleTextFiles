WAITING FOR MY FORTUNE

There had been times, when no one cared.
I've heard thunder crashing [within / in] my own head.
[There was] nothing left to say, [I was] too down to walk away,
So I held on, waiting for my fortuneÂ«

[When] suddenly you walked into my life,
changing [almost] anything with one look of your eyes.
I remember, that you took my hand,
[84]: to take me in another land,
where the people live within every moment.
[2016]: We lived every moment.

But life goes on and changes more than one time,
everyone and everywhere.
Within a lifetime no one can walk down a straight line,
For nobody knows, where the way ends.

As suddenly as it began, [as/so] suddenly we were to end.
You said, you couldn't stay, you said, it wouldn't matter
And you said, that I'd been nice.
I was alone and I was low, again I didn't know, just what to do.
[84]: I reached out for your hand and I simply couldn't understand,
it all should be over.)
[2016]: I did not realize, that it was over, long gone.

Refrain:
It's been so simple to let go the things, you gave me without knowing,
[84]: That I'd soon get addicted and that you'd soon get tired,
[2016]: that it soon would end, you would get tired,
to pick me up, whenever I was low.
[It has been] hard for me to face [+it], [and] it has [hardly] passed my grasp,
You could not really love me and
[84]: I could not break free.
[2016]: we could not get back.
[84]: I was too weak, I was in love too much.
[2016]: to where we started before we were in love too much.
