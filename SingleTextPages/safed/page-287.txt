RIGHT NOW

Right now I feel quite alright, though I don't know
'bout the things to come.
'See a change as a chance, I know that it isn't all gone.
I still believe what shall be surely is to come.
I'm glad I'm living, it hasn't all gone wrong.

Refrain:
For the first time things are changing in a way I knew they could.
For the first time in my life I'm acting like I always wished I could.
I take time to see what happens and I'm old enough to wait.
I am willed to work on myself, I will try it differently.
I am willed to work on my life, because there is a light I see.
So maybe nothing ever changes in the places I left
and friends I had may always flee,
But I'll try out a new way, I won't throw away my keys.
I know about my chains and opportunities and I know people,
that I love and I'm not willing to give up now, because
