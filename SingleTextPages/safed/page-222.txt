QUICKSAND

Just another of God's children being thrown
right into a world of his own.
Depending on a dream to get high.
'Creating me a wing just to fly.

Bridge:
And it may happen in the city,
when the lights are down
but the heart still pumps.
It may happen in the city,
cause it has happened before.

Seems my life depends on that dream.
It is where my laughter comes from.
It's what I always wanted to do.
It just needs to become true.

Bridge

Refrain:
Still I'm walking on Quicksand,
unsure about the end.
I'm walking on Quicksand,
unsure about the end.

Quicksand, Quicksand!
Quicksand, unsure 'bout the end.
