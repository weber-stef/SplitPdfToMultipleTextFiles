I'VE GOT A PICTURE

In many ways, it's still the same thing to me,
than it did, when you lay in my arms, girl.
I've got a picture of you left on my wall,
I look at from time to time.
Refrain:
Lately I'm glad that I have taken ways,
that made me come across your path one day.
Lately I'm glad that we have shared our ways,
till we had to part finally, going on our own ways.
And it doesn't even matter, whom you're kissing now.
There's nothing here to wipe out my memories.
And although things are over and I don't see you now,
Nothing is able just to make small, what's been.
Refrain
Bridge:
Maybe, we'll meet again just one day,
when we're expecting it the least.
Maybe our ways will cross again one day.
Who knows what comes further on.
