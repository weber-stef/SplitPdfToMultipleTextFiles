TONIGHT

Today was much too ordinary. Let's get crazy tonight.
I want to climb the highest mountain just to be with you tonight.
Bridge:
Tonight's meant to get crazy with it's bright shining lights
and especially the one in your eyes.
Tomorrow might change everything,
What's been crazy becomes normal.
So let's take our chances tonight.
Come with me in a land of pleasure, feel my heart beat tonight.
The memory'll be my biggest treasure, feel my heart beat tonight.
Bridge
