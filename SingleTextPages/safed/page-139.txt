YOU MAKE ME FEEL CONFUSED

You've got me paralysed, I am under your spell
I think I would believe you, whatever you might tell me now,
It's obvious I adore you, I don't want to deny.
My desire for you is so immense, don't you try to hide away now.
Bridge:
Don't you try to run away for cover.
I've not planned to do you any harm.
Just try to understand my inner yearning.
Baby I'm mesmerized, I can't keep calm.
Refrain:
You make me feel confused - This must be love.
You make me feel confused - I am in love with you.
1 just want to make you feel interested, want you under my spell
And I admit that you can't believe everything I tell you now.
Want to say my arms around you, I don't know what to do.
Baby, believe me my main interest is just to get through to you.
Bridge
