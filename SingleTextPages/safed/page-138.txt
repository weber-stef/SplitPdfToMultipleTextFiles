A PASSAGE TO INDIA

We all started together. We were going to India.
Seven weeks to realize, what this country's all about
We saw children as we passed high bridges.
They were looking for some food.
We had to stop to let holy cows walk by.
We all were in a strange kind of mood.
Refrain:
Oh, this is a passage to India,
oh, we're on a passage through India.
We started to feel puzzled, 'cause you finality realize, who you are,
Just surrounded by a different culture,
different people, different landscape, different art.
We had trouble to find out just what was happening,
till we heard their music and we had a smoke.
Till we realized that we were really within,
even though we were just sitting In that train.
