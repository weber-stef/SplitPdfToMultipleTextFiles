THE ACE 2010

Heaven is all that way up from where this is
What you have not experienced is what you miss
Seems it's just about one question
Right place and right time?
That is where you are not now
that you did not find

Refrain:
Take me to the hightest mountain
cause I wanna fly
Head over heels through the clouds
in a big sky
Let the tables turn then finally
give me the Ace soeone
And it's gonna be different
It's gonna be, It's gotta be great.

What if on the highest mountain there's nothing to see
Does it have to be over before it's begun?
I wanna know for sure that
the opportunity's on
to live my life like I want to
It's only just begun
