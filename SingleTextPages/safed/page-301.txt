THE REAL ME

Give it a try and give me a chance,
Give me a thing I can believe in.
Show me a way home and leave a door open
So I might return to the outside.

I just need to find out
what makes a life different,
how to avoid the banalities.

I am tumbling still,
though I want to walk straight.
Please help me to see what I need see.

Bridge:
The real me he would delete
the warder and prisoner in me.

Confused in the daytime,
crazy all the night.
So how is the time in between like?

A monster I have made,
that goes by my name
Tell me what it is, what's it doing?
