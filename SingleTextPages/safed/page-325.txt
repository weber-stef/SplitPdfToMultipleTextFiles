PLACEBO

I met her just the other day, as things went out of order.
Placebo took my hand in hers and smiled into my eyes.
“There isn't anything to fear, there isn't any trouble,
I'll kiss it all away from your heart, nothing I won't try.”
Bridge:
I think I've never been loved like that before.
Thought I'd finally leave for better shores.
Refrain:
Placebo, come caress me now, come cover me with your love.
Come tell me I'm your everything and I won't die alone.
I took her white face to my mouth and swallowed her inside me.
We powdered our noses to carry our beauty 'round the blocks.
She gave me all I wanted still I'd liked to go much further.
I just don't want to leave her now, I haven't got enough.
Refrain:
Placebo, come caress me now, come cover me with your love.
Come tell me I'm your everything and I won't die alone.
Placebo, come caress me now, stroke my head, baby, touch me,
Come help me get the feeling I've always been looking for.
Love me for real!
