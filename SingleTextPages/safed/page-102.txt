I'LL HOLD ON

Here we are, headed for the next run.
We can get far, for our strength is our age.
We won't get anxious in the dark nights and at cold days.
We won't get tired and we're never going to sag.

Here we are, together in the first line.
I hold your hand, girl and I look into your eyes.
I love the way, your tender lips move upon my skin.
I love the way, you hold me tight.

And this will hold on forever.
And this will hold on, forever more.

Refrain:
For almost anything in my life,
baby would mean nothing without you.
And if you'd ever leave me, baby,
I wouldn't know, what to do, for I love you.

There we run, with our noses in the wild wind,
Your curly hair begins to dance around your neck.
You're laughing happily and your kiss is on my lips.
You're really everything I ever hoped to get.
I hold you close and I can feel your heart beat,
and your hands, moving all upon me.
I am in flames again and dying just to make sure,
that you are what I need.

And that I'll hold on forever.
And that I'll hold on forever more.

Refrain
There's a thing you should know.
It's that I won't ever go.
And if I may tell you so,
It's just a bad joke.
