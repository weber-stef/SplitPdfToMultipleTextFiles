MEGALOMANIAC FALL

It's been dark night as I heard the sirens,
Loud and shrieking tones breaking into the silence.
I was lying in a Church not been destroyed yet;
Waiting in my wet cloth for the next wave to come.
Refrain:
"Well, don't you get megalomaniac.*
We've told our leaders before.
"We don't want to get caught in our own traps,
We don't want to fall at all."
And as I stood up looking all around me
I saw lot's of others lying face to the floor
And an old man stood up and told me
I should just lie down, there would still come more, there would still come more.
Refrain
Screaming I ran along burned houses, ruins in the pouring rain
Rain that did not really cool me, burning hot and black on my whole skin
Refrain
Don't want to fall at all
Don't want to get involved
Don't want to start no war
Don't want to fight at all
