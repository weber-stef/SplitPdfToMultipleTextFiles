LIFE IN REVERSE

Flashes in my head just like the Undead
Nothing is quite what it seems
King without a crown, forever undone,
Kingdom, nobody can see.
Bridge:
It's been a pleasure and it's been quite long.
Give me the real thing.
No hidden treasure and no will too strong
Gimme the shrink's shrink.
Vision full of errors a face in a mirror, that's completely unknown to me.
All colours become one, pictures come undone,
Don't give me a life in reverse.
Bridge
Refrain:
Vision failure, misty scene
Time shift smooth and no extremes
Is this a real life?
