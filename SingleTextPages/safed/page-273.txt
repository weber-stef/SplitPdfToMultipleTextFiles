COLOURED PAPER

Expensive cat food for the pussy cat
And the cheapest dog food for the old ones.
We risk to choke on superfluity,
meanwhile whole continents are starving.

Refrain:
But those funny coloured papers
 they will never help you to see
just how poor you are.
So just buy yourself some company
but leave me out.
Your money stinks!

You'll find someone to sleep with
if you'll pay for any sigh.
Even someone to tell you
your beloved lies.

Refrain
Bridge 1:
Man is fighting,
Man is fighting himself,
kneeling down before his golden calf.
Man is lying and he lies to himself,
Weâ€˜re destined to die alone.

Bridge 2:
They will put you in a wooden case
down in the ground.
With no more wealth to shelter you,
no money left to count.
Compared to infinity
you're just another dwarf,

selling his soul to a lifeless golden calf.
