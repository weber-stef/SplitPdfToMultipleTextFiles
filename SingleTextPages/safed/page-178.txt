WOLF JUMPS

It's the innocence and instincts of a dangerous creature.
It might hurt you without really knowing.
But it's high time to be ready to defend yourself,
when the wolf jumps.

Refrain:
There is no guilt in what it does
for it's just made of danger and of fear.
It's claws touch it's friend so gently,
but it is high time just to be prepared,
When the wolf jumps.

It's a powerful fast beauty, you can never control,
Although you might look right into those eyes.
For you can never be sure, what's been worked out in that brain,
when the wolf jumps.

There's a shining in those eyes, that can be paralyzing,
while that body slowly moves towards you.
Just keep calm and watch each step, so you can save your soul,
when the wolf jumps.

Refrain:
Is there a guilt in what she does
Seems she's just made of danger and of fear.
Her hands do touch her friend so gently,
but it's hard not to fall because of her,

Wolf jumps!
