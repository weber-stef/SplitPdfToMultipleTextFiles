WONDER WHY

Hard enough to see you go, hard enough to see you go down,
Hard enough to be someone else.
Babe - I don't know where I'm coming from.
You caught me in the middle, you found me in between the chairs.
You hit right me in between my legs.
I woke up to find a million tears.
Refrain:
And I wonder why it took me so long just to see you cry.
And I wonder why it took me so long to find out that you'll never try.
You caught a glimpse of my life
Refrain:
And I wonder why it took me so long just to see you cry.
And I wonder why it took me so long to find out that you'll never try.
And I wonder why it took me so long, we went such a long way.
And I wonder why it took me so long just to see.
Bridge:
I've been up and down, all around this town,
I walked around without aim.
Ups and downs it all happens again,
seems the circle is never changing.
Babe I've been in love so many times before,
still I cannot turn away, even though I should.
And so I'm here on my own.
