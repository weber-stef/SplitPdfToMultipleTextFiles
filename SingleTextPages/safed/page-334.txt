LIES SUCK

I don't know what you're saying but you're talking too fast,
too much, too loud and I just don't believe you.
I don't know what you're thinking 'bout me, 'bout him,
'bout us, 'bout us. If only ever I knew..
Refrain:
You don't look me straight in the eyes.
You just go on telling me lies.
Lies suck!
I bet you are believing in your very own truth
Lies suck, they kill - It hit me out of nowhere.
I don't know what you're thinking 'bout me, 'bout him,
'bout us, 'bout us â€“ The trouble is I still care.
Refrain
Bridge:
The trouble is I was unaware then
I could happen to me without being planned.
So what am I to do now
