ANYWAY

Walking through the city, opening eyes, while you wish to be blind,
there's a crazy kind of feeling that arises inside.
Are you out of your mind?!
Not even surprised just to meet somebody talking to himself;
somehow lost and somehow found in all his lonely madness,
while he's killing your nerves.
Refrain:
Anyway - I follow rules that I made up by myself.
As long as there's someone to care.
I am twenty six years old, running around.
Tell me - what have I found?!
For as I sing 'bout love and courage, Nazis burn my land down.
This world 's made up by media, you can switch off,
when you got enough.
And I cannot even calm myself with larger amounts
of what I call drugs.
Refrain:
But anyway - It's still important to me to talk 'bout banalities.
I still am afraid to die.
In a way - I close my eyes and think back
on how I think it has been.
'Does it matter yet it's a lie?!
