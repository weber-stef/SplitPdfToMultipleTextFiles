IT'S HER EYES

(DEKAEM 265)

So you've been there
And now you are here.
So what's the use in pretending
This won't happen again.

You've been so close
And now she's so far
But still she lingers in your head
And you just can't let her go.

Refrain:
It's her eyes you're thinking of
It's her breath on your skin
It's her laughter that you miss
How come it all went that wrong?
