FOUR O'CLOCK

Four o'clock in the morning,
another nightmare's begun.
I try to flee through narrow tunnels in a big, big house.
I just creep, I don't run.

But I'll never ever get away
what I'm running away from
And it won't give up tilll it reaches me,
won't leave a thing undone.

Refrain:
When I wake up, breathing heavily, I seek the enemy behind.
But I cannot find him, because he is right here.
I feel afraid, ashamed and guilty for things I haven't even done,
because I don't know, what's going on with me.

I see a lot of pretty girls each day,
but they are all the same to me
And I already feared I'd lost my sex,
it feels so very strange to me.
I need a girl to knock me down
and drag me home in her bed.
Tender me and cover me
and don't leave me sad.

Refrain

Bridge:
I'm not half the man I used to be,
just look into these eyes.
I feel so very differently ;
like living on lies.
So if my attitude's not changing
then it is quicksand, I'll walk on
I fear I will be drowning.
Tear me out.
