LOVE IT, HATE IT

And still those lovely eyes,
you saw a thousand times,
don't fail to make you smile.
You fought a thousand times,
can't seem to get it right,
but you want to stay a while.
It seems a simple thing,
sometimes without this game
you would be much better off.
You look for words to say,
a reason just to stay,
but you can't find what it takes.
And still those lovely eyes,
you saw a thousand times,
don't fail to make you smile.
You fought a thousand times,
can't seem to get it right,
but you want to stay a while.
Refrain:
Love me tender and love me long, get over my head.
Forget the bad things, let's just be strong - It's worth the long run.
I hold my head up and won't be gone, hope you will be there.
Love it, hate it - This is you and me.
