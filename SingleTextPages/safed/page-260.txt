THE LESS

They say my face has changed - no kid any longer;
It would just depend on me now.
Yet I cannot explain, I don't understand it,
'used to find a way to slip through.

Refrain:
The further I get
the less I move
the less I can see things through.

You can't help me out, you cannot understand
you can't make me feel any easier.
You try to help me while you try to change me
while I don't know where I am going.
