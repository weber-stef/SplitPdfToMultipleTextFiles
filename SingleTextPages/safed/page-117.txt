HUNTED

There's something knocking on my window,
something evil after me,
hunting for me.
Around me I hear moaning voices,
I am not safe in this house,
tension's rising.
I feel the sweat drops on my head,
I feel my hands are cold and wet.
It's like a nightmare.
But I can't get the something
I feel into my own trembling hands,
neither out of my mind.

Bridge:
Feel the walls are closing in, seems I can't move any more.
Feel the fear is rising up and I'm not safe any more,
Ceiling's slowly coming down, I can't flee, I can't get out.
But I got to get away from that moaning, roaring crowd.

Refrain:
Don't panic, don't panic!
There's still a chance to get away.
Don't panic, not yet panic
The roaring crowd's already much too near.

I throw a chair out of my window
and I finally get out,
start to run then.
They're after me and getting faster
and the danger's all about,
hope they won't catch me.
An open door I run on in
it's a big hall, I'm hiding in,
safe for a minute.
till suddenly the lights are turned on
and I look in crazy eyes.
Staring back at me.
