TURNING IN CIRCLES

I turned in circles, every morning, when the sun came,
the place was still the same.
Looking in mirrors, I was searching for my own face,
which never really changed.

Refrain:
I soon got nervous, should it be that one way,
I needed someone to pick me up again.
I turned in circles, every morning, when the sun came,
the place was still the same.
Looking in mirrors, I was searching for my own face,
which never really changed.
Refrain
Bridge:
I was not depressed, I simply got out of my mind. It was plain to see.
It seemed to me relations changed in oh so many ways.
Certainly I'd loved in former times, but now I needed to possess.
It seemed to me my life had changed and it all went up in a mess.
I turned in circles, every morning, when the sun came
the place was still
the place was still the same.
