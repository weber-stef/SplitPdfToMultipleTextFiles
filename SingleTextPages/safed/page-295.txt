BACK HOME

I tried to concentrate on my past and on my fate but it's gone.
Trying to determinate the mistakes that I have made,
but what's won with that?

I look inside my mirror, but I can't find the one
that I have known before, 'seems he is gone.

Refrain:
Back home is where I want to be.
'close my eyes. Shelter me and cover me.
Back home, the easy way out that I've been on before.
It's gone and I cannot turn back.
There will always be this lack of innocence.

I tried to get away but I betrayed myself.
So I just walk right on and show a different shelf.
But all this pressure makes me feel sick.
Get me out of this hell, show me a trick.

Refrain

Bridge:
I'd like to be seventeen, innocent and clean,
doing everything the real first time.
Just a boy and just a girl in their magic own world,
sharing every little thing.
All filled up with love, quite high above
any problem that might just appear,
but everything's been changing, me too.
