THIS SPIRIT

How's your view of this space and what's in it?
What makes your eyes look different?
What's the clue to your life and the things that you do
What is it that you see, then when you look at me
and the things that I do?
Do you want me to behave differently?

Refrain:
There is a part of my life in your hands.
We are inside of the same dream.
There are tthoughts that I never had
if you hadn't talked to me.

We're like balls rolling down steadily,
influenced only by fate's touch.
There's no rule to the game and its sense is unknown,
Yet we look in the sky and we see all those lights
that have come out of the big dark
from a source so far off that they seem so unreal.
Maybe there's nothing left
that moment that the light is seen by our eyes
so can you really tell me what is true?
I won't try to find out what it all means,
somehow I'm only drifting, .
Still I'd like you to drift along with me.

Refrain:
I'm a part of the life in this space,
I am inside the big dream.
