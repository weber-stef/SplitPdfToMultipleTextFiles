BOY MEETS GIRL

Saw a bright light shining in the park
is this the sun or is it you who lights the dark?
I love to watch you staring at the sun
can we get closer, having fun.
In the end it's always the same
boy meets girl,
they love, they quit.
Is this what it is
constant travelling?
You and me together, you touching me
Can't stop thinking bout it, No therapy
It don't feel perfect on your own
Make me smile, go on
Just imagine you had never kissed a girl
there wouldn't be a sadder thing in this whole damn world.
If this is dumbness
life itself is dumb
Cause besides causing pain
sometimes love
can be fun, fun, fun
