CIRCUS

I had visions when I was young
that seemed so real to me.
And it all was so very close to me.

I was believing in what seemed to be true to me
and I thought, though I might change
my ideals would stay the same.

Refrain:

I walked all over dewy fields,
whose edge was the horizon
And Mother earth steamed out
all her love to me.
Love made me either fly or fall,
my world was built upon ideas.
Cannot be true the game is ove,
Circus left town.

I went on drifting down the same stream,
shore was out of sight.
tilll bit by bit the scenery had changed.
Now on the picture I remember
the colours start to fade.
And I feel lonely, so lonely and old
