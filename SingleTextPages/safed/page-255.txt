SHE TOO

Sometimes we just stay in bed all day and
some days we just argue.
Yet to spend my time with her seems to be
the best thing I can do.
She's like the flower breaking through the asphalt street
She's the one to get me back up on my feet.
Refrain:
She gives you everything that you could ask her for,
wants to know what you like best and gives you more.
She's like a fairytale, a dream that came alive.
Whenever she looks in this face of mine
it seems as if she reads me
She turns the pages of my soul
and then she understands what I see.
She's like a lady and a little girl in bed.
Every movement that she makes, it drives me mad.
Refrain
Bridge:
And when I'm feeling sad, turned inside-out,
She puts her gently lips right on my mouth
and then she makes a joke to make me laugh,
sorrows are drifting away.
