THE ACE                                        1992
                                             (08.07.)
Who doesn't want to be rich and famous
But who knows how to do?
If you don't want to pick out those friends
that you only use.

Seems it's always just one question:
Right place and right time?
If you want to get rich and famous
without selling your mind.

So what's the way it ought to be?

I don't want to be rich and famous
and blind deaf and dumb.
So could it be it had to end,
before it's begun?

I just want to know for sure that
the opportunity's on
to live my life like I want to,
it's only just begun.

Refrain:
So take me to the final mountain,
'cause I want to fly.
And give me just another kick 'cause
I want to get high.
So let the tables turn then finally
and give me the ace someone!
And it's going to be different,

It's going to be, it's going to be great!
