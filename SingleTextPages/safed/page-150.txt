BENT ON YOU

I have just had trouble, I Just thought I'd got wiser.
But life has got me in its paws again.
Softly pushing me 'round in circles, waking me up again.
I needed a bit of time to differentiate what is important now.
But it seems I found a nice way on I just need a proof anyhow.

Bridge:
No, it won't happen again.
I'll try to keep safe from each harm, if I can.
It won't be me to take your life in my hands,
But it seems my mind's bent on somebody special again.

My head is a bit dizzy and my heartbeats sound lingers,
I am a little nervous all in all.
I know, that this still is a strange Situation
It's the first time I'm breaking through walls.

Refrain:
But that's what's the meaning of it all
You are really living without chains.
It's what tenderness is all about,
you feel you fall in love again
although you know, that it might end
as suddenly as it began
That's what your feeling's all about
when you have got a special bent on
somebody special again.
