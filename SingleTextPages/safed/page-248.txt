POINT OF NO RETURN

Steadily the way may change, though it is getting clearer
Seems I'm closer to the point of no return at all.
I got used to the depression and someone in my head,
telling me I'd rather move, make true what I say.
Refrain:
In and out of trouble, while I am going on,
walking on towards the Unknown.
Trying just to grab it, as luck comes along.
Anything that it might do.
