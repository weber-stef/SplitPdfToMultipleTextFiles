WE COULD BE STRONG

I don't remember the words that I told you.
I don't remember the things that I said.
And I don't remember what time it was,
When our love meant just to be sad.

Refrain:
I just want to remind you, I don't want walls closin' in.
I just want to ask of you you, Oh babe, Don't let the end begin.
Remember, we have been together in
the most sad times of our lives.
We never forgot to care for each other,
while we were figthing against thousands of lies.

Refrain:
And though times may've changed and it grew cold unexpected,
though security's gone and I'm not sure anymore,
We should stay together, we should hold on together,
We should give ourselves, what we're beggin for.

Got to start at the bottom to get to the top.
And we'll not get it in a simple way.
Got to take the chance, got to take the straw,
Some day we too will find a getaway.

Refrain:
Let us build up what is still left,
please don't forget the things, we've done.
If we don't trust each other, who else could?
Don't you know anymore, Why you've begun?!
