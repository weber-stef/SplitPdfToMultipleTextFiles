MIRROR YOU SMASHED

I'm still in an unknown mood I can't explain.
I see you and me in places we've been to,
while I am there alone feeling pain, feeling pain.

Refrain:
I love you, you picture of somebody I need
but you can't see nothing in a mirror you smashed,
it's a different thing you need.
And from above, I'm watching the way I do behave,
but you can't see nothing in a mirror you smashed,
it's a different thing.

Bridge:
Take me out of trouble, take me out of this city
and tell me, what you believe in
and tell me one of those things is me.
'Cause I need something, need something under my skin,
pouring through my veins.
I'd much rather die, much rather die
than go on like this.

Refrain:
Because I need to have a picture of somebody I need
but you can't see nothing in a mirror you smashed,
it's a different thing you need.
And from above, I'm watching the way I do behave,
but you can't see nothing in a mirror you smashed,
it's a different thing.
