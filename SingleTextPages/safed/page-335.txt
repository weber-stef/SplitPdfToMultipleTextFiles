BARB WIRE

I can't tell you whose friend I am
and I can't tell you from where I came
It is not the same any longer,
'must be because my view of things has changed, all changed.
You grow up and become all the same.
You're very, very different but that's all in vain.
You get tired because maybe, maybe they are right, alright.
Refrain:
All of a sudden then your eyes have changed,
that's what you think's been happening.
You fail to breathe from time to time
as if you were all wrapped up in
BARB WIRE
Things, they move much slower
when you're in it for a lifetime,
You'd like to just sit down and watch them go.
And when finally your own life hits you right between the eyes
You feel as if you were all tied up in
BARB WIRE.
