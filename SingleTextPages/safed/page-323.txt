TIED UP

Confusion, eruption -
what goes on in this head of mine, growing old.
'Been in love, out of love -
what goes on in this self of mine, getting cold.
Bridge:
I'm not the same as before, seems I have changed to the core.
Refrain:
Life's got me tied up.
Yeah, every little thing has got me tied up.
Bridge 2:
I'm not the same as before, seems I have changed to the core.
Tell me what am I here for, tell me just who I am.
Refrain 2:
Life's got me tied up.
I see the scheme I don't understand.
Tied up.
Life's got me tied up.
It seems my life is slowly slipping out of hand.
Tied up.
Life's got me tied up. And there are things 'bout me I don't understand.
Life's got me tied up.- I don't know what I need,
I don't know what to need, I don't know.
