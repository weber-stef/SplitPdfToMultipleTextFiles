1988- STILL IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH

There's a chain, that holds him back again.
It's the ring around his finger,
Like he's captived in magnetic fields,
He's secluded from real life.
There's a thing, that makes her cry again,
but to tell him she still lingers.
Like she'd know, what he is thinking of,
his look cuts her like a knife.

Bridge:
Love's gone, long ago.
Love's gone with time.
It's flown away, like time did.

Refrain:
Feelings faded far away.
Feelings faded as time slipped away.
And now there's only crying.

There's something making her depressions even worse.
It's the look in lovers' eyes.
That special look,
 she once had in her eyes too,
when it all began.

One fine day, they may just feel
the same as she does now.
But yet, none of them's lying.
And he thinks 'While they're just about to start,
We're already at the end.'
