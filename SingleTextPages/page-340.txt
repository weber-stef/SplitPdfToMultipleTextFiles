MAMA DON'T CARE

I had been nervous all day - that big party ahead
Looking sharp, yeah, dressed to kill, but my hands they were wet.
The classroom was already packed, when I finally hit our school.
And amongst all the dumb dudes there she stood keeping cool.
Refrain:
But your mama don't know what your mama don't see
And your mama's not even here - Let's dance, let's sway.
We finally hit the dance floor as the fast dances were through
But she would just not let me do what I was up to do.
Her parents would be waiting, they would rely on her.
And to behave like I would do simply wouldn't be fair.
Refrain
There's a reason for this, come on give me a kiss
This one chance won't come twice.
Let's just get laid.
Bridge:
Marry me - Have my child - Be my wife some day soon.
Closer now - Kiss me now- Come alive.
