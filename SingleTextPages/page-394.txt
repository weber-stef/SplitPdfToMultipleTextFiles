IT

It's living inside your dreams and
It sees that which you see
And It is awfully close to you
It grabs you out of the black
Tears you down, you won't get back
It's creeping deep inside of you

Bridge:
Sometimes It feels good to you
You are afraid to let It go.

It lives of your attention
Beyond your comprehension
You cannot hide a single thing.
Not man, not God, not devil
There's no doubt and there's no proof
And It will never let you go.

Refrain:
It is here, inside outside.
Looks at you, see those black eyes
It is you inside, outside..
