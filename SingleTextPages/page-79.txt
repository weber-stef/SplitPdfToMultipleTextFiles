ONE TIME LONELY

Though you are away
and there are miles between us,
though we are apart, still we will go on.
Cause it is worse the time
and there is nothing between us.
Before we start, we have all long won.

Refrain:
And it's just one time lonely
it's just one time lonely
We are one time lonely,
but still we know and we'll never forget,
whom to we belong.

And though some time has passed by
and we're lonely and we're frightened,
still there'll be a place to rest for you and me.

And maybe we'll be weak someday
and maybe we won't be sure,
but still we'll be in love as much
 as only we can be.

And though some things went to slowly
and though some things have changed a bit,
I still know, that I love to hold on to our love.
And you are here and you are not,
I do love to think of you and I do not.

And we are still fighting for our love.
