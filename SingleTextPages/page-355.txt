GROUND BENEATH

Turn the page just take some time
take a look at our lives
You're not here but all this time it's only you

Bridge:
But you're much too far away from me.
Yes you're much too far away.

When I look at the pictures of my life
I see minutes pass and hours run
Tell me can man hold what he loves
Cause baby I love you
Falling down and starting over again
Tell me how many times

Bridge

Chorus:
Every minute of our lives,
the good times and the bad
make up the ground beneath our feet.
We're nothing but just grains of sand
on lifeâ€˜s eternal shores
born from the ground beneath our feet

But baby with your hand in mine
we'll build a universe
that's made from everything we need
Baby I can spread my wings,
close my eyes and fly

cause there's a ground beneath,
Your love's the ground beneath my feet.
