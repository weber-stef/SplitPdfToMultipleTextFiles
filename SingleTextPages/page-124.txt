THE ART OF LIVING

Everything is art. It just depends on how you look at it baby
Everything's a drug. It just depends on how much you take.
Everything can cause pain, can cause pain, It just depends on you.
Everything can be fun, can be fun, you just got to believe it's true.
Bridge:
Suddenly you see, that you are suffering.
To you torture turns time into tears.
But it's just because you never thought of
making your life a special one,
believing, believing, believing that
Everything is life. It just depends on you doing it,
how do you do, how do you do?
You can't keep under cover, you can't be calm, cold cries are calling you.
You got to get out, you got to get up, you got to get on running through your life.
Life ain't a circle of bad circumstances, it just depends on you!
I call for you, call for you, call for you.
Refrain:
Learn the art of living, living. Learn the art of living, living.
Learn the art of living, living. Learn the art of living, living all on your own.
You know, that it just depends on you!!
