SCIENCE FICTION

Millions of light years far out there,
far too far to be understood
must be some kind of thing,
something now happening
I would die to see if I just could..

Refrain:
So will we finally find out
if a life without frontiers always stays
Science Fiction?

Lights up in the sky look so real
I can almost grab them with my hands
How important am I to the stars way up high
Do they shine on when my life will end?

Refrain

Bridge:
Me, somewhen finally falling to dust
Could it be there's a thing in me
that I could trust in, believe in
I'll find one day?
