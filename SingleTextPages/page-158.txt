IN DEVOTION TO LIFE                            1986
                                              (19.08)
I always had trouble,
when trying to look through things,
that happened in my life.
I learned, that it's foolish
to try to explain everything.

Sometimes without real reason,
life's got a different meaning to me.
Sometimes it feels serious,
sometimes even mysterious,
it's a rolling wheel.

Bridge:
Life is a puzzle of emotions,
seems like a never ending motion.

Refrain:
Don't you run, don't you hide,
just keep going, your head held high.
Try to do your own life
and don't believe in lies.

I'm not at all calm yet,
I'm living it all out,
a life in devotion to life.
I'd not ask for changes,
not try to make done things undone.
I still love to love love
in all of its aspects,
it's the mysterious root of my life.
Millions of days
will never make the sun's face turn to dark.
