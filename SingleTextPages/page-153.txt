COLD AS ICE

To be moved by strings, well it ain't that easy,
to just not to know, what to do any more.
You seem to get weak, you seem to get crazy.
You just do not know, what to do any more.
Bridge:
But still you try to realize, what's going on.
And still you try to move on, but you won't get too far,
you won't get too far. It's much too late.
Refrain:
She has got you in her hands and you don't look through her plans.
She controls everything you do while she's as cold as ice to you.
The curtains move up, it's high time for acting.
Time to start to move in a kind of a spell.
So don't you speak to me, don't ask, how I like it.
Don't know, how to like it. It's Heaven'n'Hell.
Bridge
