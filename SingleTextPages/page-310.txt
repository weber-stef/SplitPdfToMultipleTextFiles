ON THE ROOF

When I came home today, somehow the place had changed.
Those rooms looked pretty empty, so I just called your name.
' Went in the bedroom cause I thought that you might sleep.
But yet instead I found crashed guitars on the sheets.
Refrain:
I'm on the roof, just drinking, well baby I don't care.
On the roof, bored of thinking about how you could dare?!
On the roof, I see clearly now, you don't know what you'll miss.
From the roof, If I will stumble you're to blame for it,
to blame for this catastrophe.
We've had a happy time, I nearly am a star.
What did you mean by saying that I went off too far?!
Well don't you recognize how I helped you to grow?
What's that?! You need to have a life of your own?!
Refrain:
I'm on the roof. It's oh so clear to me, I'll make it without you.
On the roof, high are my spirits cause I finally found the truth.
On the roof, nobody dare to tell me I was blind.
From the roof, maybe finally I will reach the sky
and you'll wonder why I can.
