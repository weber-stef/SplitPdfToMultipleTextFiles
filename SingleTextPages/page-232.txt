FINALLY

You're quiet, you're listening to those sounds outside your door.
Could it be, he's coming to make you talk 'bout your life?
You're dreaming, he enters and sits right down by your side.
so close he was never, the question never so clear.
Refrain:
Who are you, what have you done up to this final day?
He is there finally but yet you do not feel fear.
He may have come to take you, but he might just as well leave.
Then he talks and asks you what you see, looking at life.
Then he says it's just you to decide, if you're willed to join him.
Refrain:
There's a light beyond life, beyond our reality.
In his eyes, in our tthoughts, lighting up eternity.
