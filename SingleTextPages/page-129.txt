A GIRL WE BOTH KNOW

Let me tell you 'bout a problem that I have;
It's a girl, we both know and she drives me mad.
She's got dark brown eyes, got dark brown hair,
she looks just as you do
and a smile of her means really much to me.
Bridge:
Sometimes I feel sad, cause she will never know
And what I feel for her's in vain.
But her eyes are shining bright to me,
they're so fascinating,
I can't flee.
She's the kind of girl, you never can resist.
But her eyes are shining bright to me,
they're so fascinating, I can't flee,
She's a kind of girl, that reminds me much of you,
Reminds me much of you.
It's a strange kind of a problem, I do have,
I'm afraid that feeling could grow much too strong.
I'm afraid, that each attempt could make me fall down on my knees
And every begging for her love will make a fool out of me
Bridge
