MEMORIES

Sometimes I lie awake all night, thinking about my past.
All the plans I had and what has happened since then.
Sometimes I feel so useless doing stupid jobs to pay my rent
because I still sing 'bout being free, being who I want to be.
Refrain:
My memories, all my dreams
they sometimes sort of haunt me.
I've been free way back when
things were much easier, easier then.
C'mon my friend just tell me the eyes inside the mirror
do they look the same they used to do?
We're talking about our plans, still we just live in memories
tell me where's all that power gone where are all our ideals?
Bridge:
Sometimes I feel so down and out, living out a lie.
All my dreams they seem so useless then
like punk being thrown away.
