LIFT IT UP

There's too little light on your sweet face.
You got to move on closer, so I can see your smile.
For if a lot of happy moments make up a happy life,
why should we waste any more time?
For time rushes on by even while we sleep,
but I don't want to waste tonight,
because you're much too neet.

Refrain:
Lift it up.
I want to take you
way high up,
I want to make you see

the real me.

During this evening we touched several times,
as if we didn't care, as if we wouldn't recognize.
But that was far too less to please me,
I want to get to know
your smile, when you touch me,
your eyes, when we're getting real close.
'Gonna reach out for your big, big heart,
'here to reach the inside.

Refrain

Bridge:
We got to go down to the centre of everything,
We got to lie down, girl I need to touch you.
I don't want to bore you, doing things you don't want to do.
I got to be inside you, a part of you.
