TO TAKE A SHOWER

(as the day begins)

We take a shower as the day begins.
The water drops down, as we talk
about what we do today and where we'll go to,
what's going to happen round us now.

You say, you'd like to go out for a walk now,
just one time all around the fields.
I do agree, but I do have to admit,
now all, that I do need's to eat.

We're walking down a narrow street, we both know.
We walked along here many times.
Nothing has ever changed, since we first met here.
Just to squeeze us for a while.

Refrain:
And I will always remember
walking along here, having you near.
running through the city, lying down face to face.

We talk again, before we go to bed,
before I lie down by your side,
'bout being really sure, we're independent,
being really sure, that we don't lie.

It's getting easier to get real lucky,
while your face is close to mine,
and I feel happier, for I am sure now,
that until morning, there's still time.

I put my hand under your head to be sure
I still can touch you, you are mine.
You're lying close to me and you breath quietly
and I can gently kiss you, to show, that I care.

Refrain:
And if you woke up suddenly it wouldn't matter,
we would just fall asleep again.
No matter, what happens suddenly,
you can be sure, I'll watch out.
