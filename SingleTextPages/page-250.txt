CAGES

We dream of freedom living in cages,
fill them with memories and then lock them up.
Yearning for company we travel Underground,
And while we move we fear somebody might talk.
And it feels oh so sane - I see the crowd around me
and still I feel alone right here.
Refrain:
Cages in our heads build walls all around us.
The frontier we face is the spirit inside
avoiding our fortune.
Take me home!
Knowing the steady ones might change the whole System
all of a sudden we decide we can't move.
And how we'd love to change all the injustice
we recognized on our television - screen.
And it feels oh so sane there's such a mess inside me
And yet I'm running on, yet I don't rest.
No rest for the Wicked!
Refrain
