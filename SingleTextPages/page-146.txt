YOUNG

Well, it's not just for the satisfaction, it's for the action itself.
Just like something, that you take for sweeten for life
but perfect in itself.
You can have it any time and each day, it just depends on you.
You can do it in so many a way, it will be always good for you.

Bridge:
And Darling, if you need my helping hands,
I will help you as good as I can.
And I think you'll like it in the end.
I'll be there just for you.
Nothing else I'd rather like to do.

Refrain:
Cause I've seen clouds in my life's sky and I know,
how fast time can go by.
So let me invite you for this night, stay by my side,
 I'll try to make it right for you.
For me life has just begun and it is an ever growing fun..
I like to do it, and if you knew it, it couldn't be wrong,
for we are still so young.

Well, if you like to have a taste dear, why don't you come with me.
Let us spend a night just playing games girl,
there won't be no looser, you will see.
I want to spend my time just helping
you feel what you are able to do to me.
C'mon let's play a game of ups and downs now,
the nicest game I know.
