AND THE DREAMS ARE LEFT UNSEEN

Here are the people. Here are their eyes.
Opened up in today's talking,
Messing around in today's world,
Here are they talking, what life's about.
"Well, it means nothing, it's just a word.‚Äù

Refrain:
And you imagine, what they are talking about,
Cause they'll be talking, till you're gone.
You can be listening, but still at the end
You won't know just what to do.

And you will see, there'll be no sigh and no scream.
And the dreams are left unseen.
Yet someone loves you, then you are left.
And you simply wonder, if this is the end.
"Love just means nothing, it's just a word.",
Whose content you don't understand.
