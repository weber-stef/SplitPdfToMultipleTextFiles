MISTRUST

Like something was outside your door, waiting in the dark
Something walking close behind, waiting for a chance
to finally put you in a maze and laugh at your mistakes
and watch you while you're slowly going crazy.
Refrain:
Insanity or truth? Reality or nightmare?
It just feels like an enemy you don't know how to fight.
It's slowly creeping in your mind
and puts out all the lights,
You're running through the darkness,
tumbling against the walls.
It's there somewhere outside and in your head.
Refrain
Bridge:
I can't tell you whose friend I am.
I can't tell you from where I came.
lt's not the same, my view of things has changed.
I don't trust you, I don't believe I should.
