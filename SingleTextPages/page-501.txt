BREEDING AND CARE

Deep inside the tube, I am so far away:
You were running late, so I just hid away.
And you will not find me and you will not see.
I am here and there, I am near and far.

Breeding and care, there's more to it than that.
You meet who lives inside only after that
You are one and you try to be many my friend
A light burns bright in your head.

Bridge:
Pleasing to the eye, how you jump through all the rings,
Perpetual movement only you can see.
Just wait a while, you'll have everything that you want
The songs and the life and the house.
When it`s getting dark, just switch all the lights out.
No questions asked everything is just fine
You look marvelous, just like in the old days
The songs and the life and the house.

If you doubt too much you will be at strife
Call it ignorance, call it way of life
Is there something more to it? I'll leave it alone.,
You have once decided this world is your own..
Deliberate im movements, head about to burst.
You swallow too much, but you won't quench your thirst.
You are who you are you're too dizzy to turn
Just a question of time?
