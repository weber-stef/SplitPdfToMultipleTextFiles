COLD AS ICE (2016)

What goes up must come down.

To be moved by strings, well it ain't that easy,
you just do not to know, what to do any more.
You're looking so weak, your heart without color,
Can't find a way, you are destined to go..

Bridge:
And still you try to realize, what's going on.
Try to hold on to something - you won't get too far,
you won't get too far. It's much too late.

Refrain:
The thing has got you in its hands and you're not looking through the plan.
She controls everything you do , everything you do
while she's as cold as ice to you. - She's cold as Ice.

The curtain, it falls, it is time for acting.
And you start to move - strange kind of a spell.
So don't you speak to me, don't ask, how I like it.
Don't know, how to like it. It's Heaven'n'Hell.

It's gone wrong, she's too strong, she makes a fool out of you.
It's gone wrong, she's too strong, making a fool out of you.

Bridge:
And still you try to realize, what's going on.
Try to hold on to something - you won't get too far,
you won't get too far. It's much too late.

Refrain:
But she has got you in her hands and you're not looking through the plan.
She controls everything you do , everything you do
while she iis cold, cold, she's so cold.

SOLO

She has got you in her hands and you're not looking through her plans.
It's gone wrong, she's too strong, making a fool out of you.
