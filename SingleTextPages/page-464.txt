NEW YEAR'S EVE

The sun is ceasing, the day has gone on by.
Time keeps on crawling through the night.
I'm lying here in my bed I'm just wasting time.
There is nobody by my side.

Bridge:
Nobody ever knows just where the journey ends
And why it is we do all this.
If you're alone and you don't want to be
Just what are you waiting for?

Refrain:
Better than yesterday and even better soon
Kiss me, keep smiling at me
I don't care if it's there forevermore
If your move would be wise.

And when the day comes it is gone for good
We've had our time, plenty of time.
We've been smiling and laughing with each other.
You haven given me your hand
You were ready to go

Bridge
Refrain.
