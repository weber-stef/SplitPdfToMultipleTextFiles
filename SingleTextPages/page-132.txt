SEASONS - PROLOGUE

"We know that every existing thing is divided into little parts.
Every chemical element is made up by the power of its molecules,
each machine works because of its little wheels,
every living creature has its' good and its bad.
Evolution was divide into several states,
passion is a game of love and hatred
and the year is divided into four seasons:
It's spring, when everything starts
and the nature shows all of its power;
It's summer, when the passion rises
and your tthoughts are heated
by the warmth of your surroundings.
But as the last two parts of the year begin,
confusion and depression start again.
It's the autumn, who has got the highest rate of suicides and
It's winter, when everything living just dies away.
