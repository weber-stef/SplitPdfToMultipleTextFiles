TELL ME 2015

Good mornimg, here‘s another day, just like any other day.
Waking up just doesn‘t feel o.k, something is wrong with me.
Intellegence in slumber still, typical run of the mill.
When your coffee is your only thrill,
It‘s time to rethink things, rethink things.

Refrain:
Take me out of trouble, take me out of this city
and tell me, what you believe in and tell me one of those things is me.
Cause I need something under my skin, right inside my blood.
Tell me, you want me, Tell me, you want me

Like a fish inside a net, a man without a head,
who lost the God, he never met, I feel lonely, lonely!
Crumbling to sand, does it make sense in the end?
There is no plan I have at hand to get through this mess.

So won‘t you join me, jump right in, let the fun begin.
There‘s no beginning and no end to what we don‘t have.
We‘re walking through this side by side, You dig for truth, I hold the light.
We don‘t have reason, we don‘t have rime,
Let‘s use that baby, express ourselves!

Refrain:
Take me out of trouble, take me out of this city
and tell me, what you believe in and tell me one of those things is me.
Cause I it under my skin, right inside my blood.
Baby, tell me, you want me, tell me, you want me.

Like any other day ..
