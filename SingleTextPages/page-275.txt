VERTIGO

I was way high up, as I was starting to fall,
wondering about what might come.
Falling to the depths - Oceans of thieves
Landscapes open seas - Eternal dreams.
Refrain:
Vertigo
It's on my mind while I try to get up.
Higher still!
Would you believe me, if I would tell you
the only thing I need is an opened mind.
Picture being alive, eternal view
Spots in the endless space - Just things to do
Refrain
