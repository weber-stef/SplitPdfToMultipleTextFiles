NO LIGHT ON THIS HORIZON

Over and out it's the last call
Should I hope to awake while I sleep
Put the course in the hands of my compass
I am somewhere out there
Well it is oh so black and so quiet
and it seems to move too slow for me
I expected it to be amazing
where did that come from?
Bridge:
It's a light I havent seen yet;
Still it could be dangerous; we never met before
It invaded all my bubble will it be forevermore
Is it foe or am I friend?
Refrain:
No light on this horizon.
Your conscience in a bubble, will it last forevermore?
No light on this horizon.
You might be a million years big, yet you crumble at the shore.
No light on this horizon.
Safe the best for later and just come back to the core.
No light on this horizon.
this is you, this is you!
