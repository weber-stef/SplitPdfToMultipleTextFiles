MR FOSTER

I'm getting down the staircase, slowly step by step.
I'm getting to the front door, walking out.
My clothes are not fitting, I am unshaven since days,
I Put my hands deep in my pockets, as I walk,

Bridge:
I am in a very bad state of mind,
just walking around,
just wasting my time.
And I got no hope on my mind, no hope of mine.

You know, it cost a thousand dollars to let live a man,
but you can kill him for 'bout twenty cents.
and even if it's more, it would never reach the mark
of the costs of the secrets of your land.

Bridge:
I am in a very bad mood tonight,
cause the stars are shining much too bright.
and I got nowhere, I could hide,
no place of mine, I know, they will say

Refrain:
“Yes, Mr. Foster, he had principles, he wasn't just looking for some cash.
We are so sorry, he had to leave us. He was such a good friend.
Yes Mr. Foster, he could hear acute, and he never ever made a fault
until that night, when he cried out, he had to leave us.
We are so sorry, that he's dead.
We are so sorry, Mr. Foster is dead.”

I'm walking down the street, two men are at my back.
I can hear them talking just 'bout banal things,
Until they start to run, start running after me,
until they do aim at a target.

Bridge:
I am in a very bad mood tonight,
just walking around, just losing time
and I got no hope on my mind.
