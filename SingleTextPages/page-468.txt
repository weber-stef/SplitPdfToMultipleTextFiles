THE MOON IN THE WATER

The night is wet and cold, my body weighs the world.
I feel useless, weak and old, hollow shell.
It seems so long ago now, somebody loved me
Like a magnet I just pull sorrow close to me.

Bridge:
The same place, a different time and it‘s also looking different.
and it seems, my brave old world, it got lost in time.
And my eyes they face the ground and there I see
in the muddy dirty water - the moon..

Refrain:
When you‘re feeling down, when you‘re all alone
Take your time to have a real good look at it.
Everything you see is part of your world
you can do anything what you see belongs to you.

The night is black and cold ..

Bridge:
The same place, a different time and it‘s also looking different.
and it seems, my brave old world, it was lost in time.
And my eyes they face the ground and there I see
in a dark pool of water - the amazing moon..

Refrain:
When you‘re feeling down, when you‘re all alone
Give it time to have a good look at it.
Everything you see is part of your world
you can do anything what you see belongs to you. x 2

what you see belongs to you, what you see belongs to you.
Like the moon in the water - Like the moon in the water.
