THE RETURN

She's the one to look at me opening up my eyes.
She's the one, who always is right here by my side.
Bridge:
I think if she took away her eyes, the picture surely changed.
And though I still could stand alone, I would not be the same,
She's the one, who dragged me out a sad life's muddy ground,
I did her wrong and in return, she made me love again,
Bridge:
I think if she took away her love, the picture became grey.
It would be hard to see things through and I might go astray.
The guy has changed since he has found a girl, he wants to stay.
He felt unsure, but with her love, I bet, he finds the way.
Refrain:
I bet, het just loves it and it's growing steadily.
I bet, he just hates to be without love again
