NOTHING IS REAL

Simon dislikes the taste of the movement.
He's surrounded, yet they're all alone.
People's faces, whose eyes fail to see you,
yet, they still observe you.
Refrain:
It might get him down, yet, he just don't care.
Feels like nothing is real.
Simon lives in a place, that is not his.
There are high walls, which don't shelter him.
He feels restless in a restless city,
still what he wants is to live a dream.
Refrain
Bridge:
But you got to get on if you don't want to fall.
'Got to fight all that fear, You have got to believe in yourself.
