SUBDUED VISIONS

Bridge:
How can I just resist her powerful kiss,
which makes my heart and lips burn.
How am I to resist such a powerful kiss.
Can you tell me, just why I should leave before I tried.
Would you just explain why I should blow out such a light.
Might just be the one to tense me up. Confusion!
Might just turn around and shake me up. Illusions!
Bridge:
Should I try to find a straighter way
Or may just turn this head of mine and walk away?
Might just be the one to tense me up. Confusion!
Might just turn around and shake me up. Illusions!
Bridge
from all those
Refrain:
Subdued visions entailing nights just analysing.
