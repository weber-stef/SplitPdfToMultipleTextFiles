PERMANENT MOVEMENT

As you may found out, the world is turning round.
So you may move with it, or let yourself be downed.
As artificial wood burns in unreal fire, you need to find a thing
to get yourself higher.
Refrain:
Stay in permanent movement, don't you stop to search.
As she may get you down, she might just fool around,
As you may play the clown, you got to move right on.
As you may want to know, what different people do,
you got to move right on, like your life's just begun.
Refrain
