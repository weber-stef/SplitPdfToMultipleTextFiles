LISTEN

She still speaks, while my time slowly just creeps away.
And yet, I still listen boy, though different things are right on my mind.
I just don't care. It's been the same,
everywhere and it's just boring me.
I want to start walking, there's no sense in talking no more.
Refrain:
Everyone's trying to find a better way.
We don't know much about the truth.
Somewhere there ought to be a better way,
so we don't run away, we just do run.
Appear do those lights and you can feel them tight
to your face and your closed eyes.
You're blinded by running,
but somehow someday learn to see.
Bridge:
That's why I say, lately it's all been o.k.
There's a sense in going on.
No way you should give up,
you've got to live it up till the end.
Don't let yourself be downed.
Refrain
