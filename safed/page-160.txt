THIS TIME

This time I'm going to tell her all about feelings,
I have hidden much too long.
This time I'm going to show her, that I know,
she's the one, to whom I do belong.

Refrain:
I don't know the feeling,
that's inside her heart,
but I know for sure,

I can't go on much longer
pretending that to me she's just a friend,

'cause that would just mean living without sense.

Because this time, it all feels so different,
nobody before did change my life in such a way.
And now I see no other way out,
the yearning to let her know my love grows every day.

Refrain:
I know it might change
her thinking towards me,
she might be gone.

But although I may lose her,
I can't go on just like this
for one more day.

I'd rather try each thing to make her stay.

Bridge 2:
'Cause it feels so lonely without her. Yes it feels so lonely without her.
And I feel, I can't be without her love, not even one more day.
