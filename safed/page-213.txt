ENTWINED

By the source of life's thunder lies the place, where we shall meet.
Being entangled and thus blinded, as our bosoms take the lead.
And as then the circle closes my heart will reach out towards thine.
We'll be thrown around by fortune then, our lives shall be entwined.
Refrain:
Drifting, moving we shall find our ways.
Entwined, not crying, never counting days.
There shall be a dangerous fire and those traps to make us fall,
but as long as we do feel love, we're to overcome it all.
There's a light, burning in your eyes, I can follow as a sign.
There's a power making me move, as long as you're mine, all mine.
Refrain
Bridge:
And though different times may come and our ways may part,
There'll be something to stay right here in my heart.
There's a flash in your eyes, I yet can't resist.
And I'm never to forget the sweetness of your kiss.
