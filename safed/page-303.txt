BIG TROUBLE

Woman lay down beside me, just give us a rest.
Mama, this man's heart is in your hands.
So don't you scratch my soul girl
and I'll give you space to breathe.
If we took a closer look, maybe we'd understand.
'Come see the places that behold my memories
and let me share yours so that I might understand
what it is that makes you act this way,
what goes on inside your head,
'cause by now I'm feeling lonely again.
Bridge:
I don't want you under my thumb,
but I want you completely.
Give me something to hold on to,
You're so important to me.
Refrain:
Finally it's always been big trouble with little things.
I'm entangled in between lust, anger and despair.
