HAVE NO FEAR

When the day is over and it's getting dark
And you are all lonely in your bed,
important to noone, a little gear
of a machine that owns the life you once had.

And the thought gets to you
is it forever more?
But who are you just to see easily
You will aleways be lonely
and you will always fear
til you realize your enemy.

It's a long way from the darkness to the light
A long way out the darkest night.

Chorus:
This very life, it just belongs to you
you want to change it, then just give it your all
if someone's making fun of what you dream
the reason is that he has no dreams at all
Every minute you are feeling good
might be the reason you were meant to be here
You are not alone in feeling all alone
Living is searching

Have no fear.
