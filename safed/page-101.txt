WHAT I LOOKED FOR

There is a very special look in your eyes,
that I never want to miss.
And there's a special kind of feeling in my heart,
whenever I touch your lips.

Refrain:
Here am I, I got all, that I looked for.
Someone like you to hold me tight.
Here am I and I found, what l looked for.
Please don't go, never leave me alone.

I still imagine myself being so lonely,
secluded in my own quiet walls.
My life was dull and all my questions were unanswered.
You were the first to hear my calls,

Refrain

Bridge:
And if I make mistakes, just tell me, that I am wrong
And tell me, what has to be changed.
And in case you're ever hurt because of my words,
Just tell me, but don't go.

And if you're not sure if I'll leave in times of trouble,
if you are not sure about me,
Please believe me, that you're all I ever do want
And that you're all I'll ever need.
