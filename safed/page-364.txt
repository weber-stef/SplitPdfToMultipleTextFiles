BREATHLESS

If anything, then I loved you,
a lot more than I wanted to
But you have just stopped giving me
your love.

Day in, day out I think 'bout you,
still searching for my point of view
so what is wrong and what is true
why do we suffer from love?

Refrain:
When I wake up in the morning,
I feel empty and I'm breathless anyway
And though I don't know an answer
I ask myself what I'm doing anyway

But right now, it's only been two days
since we've spoken out, what we already lived
I find your traces all over my place
Just like relics of a life
somebody else has lived with you.

We really wanted this to last
but it seems that I relive my past
though this time there's not even tears
It is just falling to dust,
our love is falling to dust.
