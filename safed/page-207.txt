TIME RUNS

Simon's got a problem, he cannot just solve yet.
He's in need of freedom, but he still feels sad,
when he feels an urge to be held by a lovely, tender hand,
while he knows, that he may hurt her, has to leave her in the end.
Beth she feels unhappy for she needs someone to hold.
There is something that is burning her,
though it makes her feel so cold.
She's aware that maybe tension
makes her feel that passionate
But she's still longing for something
till now she hasn't had.
Refrain:
They run, always in mind it's just a short, nice time.
They run, always expecting to find some sense and therefore
They run away for just a short nice time.
They run, always pretending to find some sense and meanwhile
Time runs!
Bridge:
Time runs, but still we get used to it.
Time runs, getting older, getting used to it.
