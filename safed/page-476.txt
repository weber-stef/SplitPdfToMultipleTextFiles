GOD'S MEN

Hey babe, who‘s lying there beside you - you‘re stuck inside of sins
God‘s men said that‘s forbidden and to bring it to an end
I read the words they‘ve shown me and left out what they chose
Well they expained it to me so I knew which were those
Refrain:
Now I know, God well he ain‘t no Hippie
he‘s more like Nixon or Saddam
Strict, because there is only one way
And it‘s the one I‘ve been explained
Hey babe, finally I‘m happy, giving all for greater things
No more confused drifting, got told what‘s good and bad
I know they‘ll help me to get better and live life everyday
without those ups and downs then that made me go astray
My head it all‘s so clear now, knowing when to stop to think
I‘m grateful for those leaders, that showed me all the links

Refrain:
You want to help? Come join in and get training
We‘ll clean this mess with sacred wrath
And in the end, we‘ll all be safe then
I know what you think before I‘ll ask
Love, It‘s so overrated
directing it right is the holy task
