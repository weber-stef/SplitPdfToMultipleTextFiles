THIS IS NORMAL

While Jane was standing at the kitchen's window,
Bert walked out of the house through the entrance door.
He looked forward to a new day, to be successful.
She had to prepare the house for being a home for him.

He got into his car and he got the wheels moving,
waved his wife goodbye and then he started off.
Jane looked up the number of the city's airport,
picked up the receiver and started to laugh.

Bridge:
It was just another day in a normal life.
Just another play of a normal wife.
Sometimes everything feels boring,
something has to change
and there is no one to be blamed.

Refrain:
Amazement must necessarily be. Amazement must be.
Amazement.

While Bert stepped on gas, Jane wiped out all the traces.
She threw away the coffee cup that Bert had drunken of,
while he just realized that he'd not taken his morning pills
and returned to the house, finding the door locked.
He opened it, called for his wife, he felt a little feverish
She wasn't in the kitchen, wasn't in the house at all.
And looking for his pills in the medicine cabinet,
he discovered an empty bottle of arsenic.

Bridge

Refrain

His face turned red with panic and suddenly he fell down,
hearing Jane laughing.
