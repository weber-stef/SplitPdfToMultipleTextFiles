ADDICTED

You have got no perspective, when you're all alone,
' feels like drowning without water.
' Not quite sure, where I will finally run ashore.
The mirror shows a different face each day,
yet always somebody, I don't know.
Just tell me, what these eyes are all about.
Refrain:
Addicted - Dependent on somebody's shelter, 'can't stand it alone.
Addicted to love - No matter how hard I may try, I am lost all alone.
The picture's damaged and the sight has changed
It seems the sun has finally faded.
Though even with closed eyes I still see you.
I hate myself but I'm afraid to be hurt
Seems the abyss has never been that close
I'm falling but I fail to reach the ground.
Bridge:
My mirror has gone crazy, my body fails to breathe.
And I'm all lost within myself.
God help me see things clearly, while I'm closing my eyes
I need to get right out of here.
