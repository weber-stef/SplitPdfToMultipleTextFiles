I WISH YOU WELL                              1985
                                            (10.08)
Sometimes it seems my whole life started
with the day I first met you.
But I am sure, that it ain't really so
and I surely can live without you.

Refrain:
So don't you take for a fool,
who can't live his life alone.
Just for a moment it is cruel to realize
you got to live on your own,
you've got a living of your own,
you should been all long gone.

Sometimes it seems I need your fingertips'
touch for each of my moves
Need you to show me, that you love me
and that your feeling is true,

Refrain:
But if I can't hold you no more,
it might be better, you'd just walk away.
For if you're not sure any more,
I think it's foolish
just to make you stay,
to try to take your doubts away
would just mean to torture us.

Bridge:
Maybe we're happy on our own,
we still can try it, we're still young
I really hope that I'm not wrong
in thinking that you'll make it,
I wish you well.
And I am sure the pain goes by,
though you're no longer by my side
and if I'd meet you by surprise,
I gently kissed you,
I wish you well.
