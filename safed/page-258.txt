FASTER FASTER

Ain't going to be happy, ain't going to get far
if you never look behind you crossing it all out in your diary.
It's always behind you, in front you'n'beside you
wherever you may run, run!
Bridge:
You can't run away from yourself, even if you run like hell.
Sometimes I feel numb when I see what's around me,
compared to what I wanted all my yesterdays.
So where is the real love and where is the real lust?!
Can't be inside this sweet smoke.
Bridge
Refrain:
Outside is inside and inside is you,
Your world is changing the way that you do.
'Can't hide away from trouble that's inside of you
Though you may even run away. Faster, faster!
Still what I say is different from what I'm able to do
I love to get high.
I drift through my world like a ship on wild water
the captain took the sails down.
