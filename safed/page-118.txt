THE KEY OF LOVE

Everybody knows you as a smart girl, but,
baby I know what you're all about.
Sometimes I wonder what you feel like,
but in the end within me, there's no doubt.
Bridge:
Once I saw you standing in the pouring rain.
And your wet hair covered your so sweet'n'greenish eyes.
Saw you standing there, but I had no time to talk to you,
had no time to change your confused mind.
But I swore to do it just another day,
for I already knew, you're just my kind.
Bridge
You have to realize how much I adore you.
Maybe then you'll find the way to heal my yearning heart.
Hey, you just got to find the key of love, baby,
Hey, you better find the key of love, honey.
Bridge
Find the key of love, Find the key of love.
And in the middle of the night, you awake and you see,
it's the only way to open up your heart.
You can call me any time.
