RAIN

Well, it seems it ain't just me
drifting between
guilt and timelessness,
feeling pleasure and harm
creeping in my mind
now and then.

I don't know, where I will go,
I don't know, what I'll do
I'm just trying to hold on
to the search for the clues
to my life.

Refrain:
I'm afraid that it's just me
that I am afraid of.
I might find myself forceless,
if the doors should be locked
as the rain falls down on me.

I am sure time is not a fact
that should rule one's life
Yet I fear an impact at the end of my flight
while the rain comes down on me.

Bridge:
So shine all you lights, shine on.
Shine all you lights, shine on me.
