CLOSER

When you wake up, weary and tired,
don't know, where to go to,
you don't know, where you belong,
just turn around, wrap yourself into my arms, I'll be there.
When nothing seems real, you fear it could all be wrong
And you just can't sleep then, cause you fear the dream to come,
Hold on to me, come closer to me.
chorus:
Just come to me, when you feel lonely,
When you feel weary, just come on close.
And when you're falling one of those dark nights,
Then I will be there, don't be afraid.
You're not alone.
When nothing seems real, you fear it could all be wrong
And you just can't sleep cause you fear the dream to come,
Hold on to me, come closer to me.
Tell me of your yearning, the land of your sweet dreams,
Maybe we could visit, just have a look someday.
It doesn't make sense to be alone, while it's the two of us.
