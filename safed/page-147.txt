STRANGE WEEKEND

Monday morning, business day,
putting my dreams aside, just living in reality.
I feel demoted, feel controled,
to me it feels so very hard to play this role.
Bridge:
Sometimes it makes me blue.
Sometimes I'm feeling like a fool.
Now I do look back
on all that was happening in the last three days,
when everything shone in bright lights, the same light.
Refrain:
Strange weekend,
what the hell was going on
Strange weekend.
Friday evening, time to play,
you feel that you are looked at and you're living gay.
Intoxicated, dreaming thief,
you steal this night away,
knowing that you have to leave
Bridge
