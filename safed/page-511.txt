WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE (KISS ME)

Look at this world, just have a look with me
Just feel the power hitting you and me
As if I knew you from before
As if I was close to a shore

Bridge:
I want you to sit on my lap,
your pretty arms around my neck

Bridge 2:
Firecrackers blazing colors, flashing over space and time
If you see it differntly, I just won‘t bother
I‘m happy feeling so alive

It hit me out of the blue - I saw you; well I had been warned
what big eyes you have, what red lips you have,
Come closer, much much closer

Refrain:
Kiss me, kiss me. I wanna find out, what we got.
Because I feel you are close, like someone else had wrote this plot.
As if I knew you knew me from before.
I want you closer to me. I feel so strange, when I‘m with you.

What big eyes you have, what red lips you have,
Come closer, much closer

Bridge 2:
.. If you see it differently, I just won‘t bother
I‘m happy feeling so alive

Bridge 3:
But you know - I see you by my side, I see you,

I want you closer to me. I feel so strange, when I‘m with you.
