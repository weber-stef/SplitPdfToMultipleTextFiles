JUNGLELAND

'Have just left the outside, I'm in a different space,
I switched all the lights off, I'm waiting for a trace
of the way to lead me through what's difficult for me.
I'm living in the city, I came from somewhere else.
It's a place without pity and it's changing everyone.
Opinions change when you're in Jungleland.
Refrain:
No place for the weak ones. No place here to rest.
Fight your fear or get lost. Burst into Jungleland.
You need a place to live in, you need something to eat.
Here you need lot's of money, there's many of those needs.
Far too less for far too many here in Jungleland.
There are many that you laugh with, but a few that you can trust.
There are lots of things to do here, but you might as well get lost,
As well as you may find your way through Jungleland.
Refrain
I have changed, I'm no longer the same.
Yet I still do resist anger to fill my brain.
I hope it is the right way that I seem to drift along.
I hope that parts of the child's mind in me do survive.
Even in Jungleland.
