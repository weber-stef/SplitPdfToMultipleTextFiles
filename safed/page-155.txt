AFFECTING ME

Back, when I was a young boy, still at my life's clear well,
I came across the female sex and it soon got me in its spell.

Bridge:
Did not know much 'bout girls, didn't not recognize their danger then,
But soon I had to learn how harmful girls are to a man.

I became older and I had to realize that sometimes
dangerous things are looking really nice.
I started wondering if my deeds were all in vain.
'Cause love causes yearning and that yearning can cause pain.

Bridge:
Didn't know much 'bout girls, misunderstood a lot of them.
Sometimes even did wrong things and so was left alone again.

Refrain:
Still it's affecting me. It's wonderful they do exist.
Still it's affecting me. A feeling I don't want to miss.
Still it's affecting me. I just can't miss a gently touch in my life.

I have met nice girls with a nice and charming attitude.
I've met the different kind too, the one you got to be in a mood for.
Woman can strengthen man, but she can make you fall.
Woman can gently kiss you or push you up against the wall

Bridge:
But you can't live without them. That's just what it's all about.
They'll go on causing you to get up, fall down or burst out.
