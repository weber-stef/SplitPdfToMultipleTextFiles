DO YOU KNOW (AMIDA)

I hold you tight, while I keep my eyes closed,
drifting through the void.
All of a sudden I am somewhere else, some other time

Bridge:
Falling, spinning constantly, until I am with you.
Show me a mirror so that I can see,
look at me and tell me why

Refrain:
Do you know, what you want with me?
Where am I and where should I be?

All of a sudden it just reappears,
It's looking differently
you're feeling good and you hold on to things
that maybe should't be

Bridge
