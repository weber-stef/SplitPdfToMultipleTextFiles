DIFFERENT TIMES MAY COME

Looking far beyond my grown up world,
I realize nothing stays the same.
The inner innocence just fades away,
you can force nothing to remain.
The first time that your eyes look at the big, wild world,
the first love that you get.
the feeling of an innocent, fast beating of your heart
it will never come back.
Bridge:
For you are changing with the years.
Seems time's is changing all of your ideas.
Refrain:
But still you're going on and different times may come,
but you are wrong in thinking you can hold on to your innocence.
I dream of running down the unknown path to places never seen,
of living in the centre of it all.
No need to rest, just going ever on, following your heart's call.
Being in love with the unexplainable, not needing any kind of plan.
Never being ruled by your brain, never realizing it could ever end.
Bridge
