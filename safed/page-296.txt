MISSING YOU

It's not just that I'm lonely, 'cause I wake up alone.
Not just that I'm lonely, 'cause there's no one on the phone.
Seems to be that it's only, 'cause I miss something else.
Could it be it was just because I'm missing you?
I am gone all mad, I'm awfully sad,
I am out of my head, I'm where I've never been.
I still remember the things we've done.
And I'm sure you do too.
Still what we see, we see differently.
Nothing will ever be the same.
And now that you're gone I turn and I run.
But the way I see it,
The trouble has just begun.
Refrain:
I've been thinking it over.
Lots of times and again.
I've been falling to pieces.
Put me together now, lift me up again
Put this to an end, just give me your hand.
For me, I burn.
