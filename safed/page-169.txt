A BIT EASIER

Often I'm uncertain 'bout the right way to go,
having no one by my side.
To me, it's most important just to feel someone's touch.
I need to hold on to bright lights.

Bridge:
Yes I tried to hide it, but I realized,
It's no means to change my confused mind.
Still I don't feel happier, being all alone.
No way out, that I can find.

Refrain:
'Couldn't my life happen in a different way, and be a bit easier.
Give me just one chance of a tender hand.

It seems so senseless to move on and on, never getting anywhere.
You might as well shout out, how down you are,
there'd be no one to even care.

Bridge:
And all those empty nights to quiet to cry, that take away your energy.
It seems you're condemned to run ever on, always failing to find a way.

Refrain

Bridge 2:
Such a long time, It's just been the same.
Empty nights and such boring days.
Does it always have to be the same to me.

Refrain

Couldn't it all happen in a different way,
in a somehow different way,
I bet it can't go on like this forever.
