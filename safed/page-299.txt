UNTIL YOU TOUCH IT

Herbertha, she was killed while she was shopping.
A teenager just chopped off her head.
He didn't dare to hurt her ; he thought it was just another game High up in
cyberspace, slightly mad.

Dimitri, he never had no girlfriend.
Loneliness, it drove him insane.
So he spent lots of money on a puppet, that can talk.
And now he's happy again.

Refrain:
You can't believe a thing is real
until you touch it.
You cannot trust your eyes no more.
A picture might be more exciting
than its subject.
So you can't trust its look no more.

Never thought of anything else than sleeping with you.
But you fail to recognize.
You cannot see that you're just a mirror in my eyes.
And you just don't realize
