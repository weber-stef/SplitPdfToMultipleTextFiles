MANIA

I wasn't quiet aware,
there could be any problem,
I didn't think of being
held back on the way.
'seems unimportant if I'm
hell bound or heaven bound
I just don't want to be fading away.
Refrain:
Mania, life speed through my veins.
Psycho, graveyard, nightmare, hell.
Caress, caress, death wish daughter of love
speed me through, cut me loose.
