I'M HEADED OUT

I got up in the night, I couldn't sleep alone.
It's a strange kind of fight, I am, doing.
Since you left me, I feel lonely,
'got to start doing something new.
I got to learn living all on my own.
Refrain:
I'm headed out for better time,
I'm headed out for a better time.
I'm headed out!
As I walked through the forest by the twilight's shining,
while the wind was howling and my hands felt cold,
I discovered a little silver chain, that I once gave you,
and I did take it into my own hands.
Refrain
Bridge:
Maybe this is not, how it used to be,
maybe I'll meet thunder on my way.
Maybe I shall meet you in a stormy night,
shall open up the doors,
open up all doors.
