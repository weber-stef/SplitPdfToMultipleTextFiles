PRETTY FACE

It's good to be standing here
Watching you doing things
you got an awfully pretty face,
awfully pretty eyes it seams

You're sombody elses girl,
at least that's what they told me
pretty young face, pretty young love, pretty sweet girl

You come from some other place
And you speak a different language
and see with different eyes

You got a pretty young face

It's good to be alive though,
Standing here talking to you
Watching your eyes gleaming,
watching your face
pretty young girl, pretty young girl, girl,
you got a pretty young face,
you got a pretty sweet face.

You come from some other place
And you speak a different language
and you see with different eyes

Pretty young face, you got a pretty young face,
Pretty sweet face, you got a pretty sweet face.
Pretty sweet laugh, pretty sweet eyes.

Me watching you.
