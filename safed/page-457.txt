ALIENS

He, take a look at that picture, can you believe, that was you?
And who‘s that guy in the corner and what is he about to do?
there‘s a million and one thing, you were about to do,
You floated a long way, no scientist, no fool.

Just stay in light, It helps you guess the way.
Food for thought comes so many ways.

Refrain:
If Aliens were ever touching
anything living here.
Think that you were chosen or stay like frozen
while they were leaving here.
One way to go, that‘s it.
It all depends on you.

Who are you in the end, in the light of this?
If it‘s just memories talking, then you have finally missed.
A million and one thing, you're still about to see.
become the person, you have wanted to be.

Close those eyes, fall and miss the ground
fear no more, you'll be safe and sound.

Refrain:
If Aliens were ever touching
anything living here.
Think that you were chosen or stay like frozen
while they were leaving here.
One way to go, that‘s it.
It all depends on you.
