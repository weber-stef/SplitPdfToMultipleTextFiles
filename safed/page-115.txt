JUST A CRAZY GUY

He's just a lonely guy standing lonesome on a corner
of a narrow dirty street, while the rain is pouring down again.
Leaning against a doorframe, cigarette has long gone out,
but he doesn't notice this, for he is thinking, .

Thinking of a time when life was not that sophisticated,
thinking of a time of easy made connections
Before he lost his freedom for a while and lived behind
those quiet walls and never talked to anyone»

Refrain:
"Now you'll need some time to start your life again.
Surely it will be hard, not everybody can.
But just try hard enough, we're sure, you'll get it right.”
- Lots of good advice from the living side.

And on the other street's side an old man leaves a dirty pub
And he stumbles and falls down on the muddy ground.
Blood trickles down the man's face and as he yells for help,
he's just looked at with disgust and slowly passed by.

But maybe it's normal only to care for yourself
and you just got to learn ignoring millions of cries.
Maybe it's crazy to reach your hand out to help
and you just got to learn to distinguish right
seeing things only in black and white.

Refrain:
"Now I need some time to start my life again,
'Got to learn to be hard, get as far as I can.
Maybe I'm really crazy, ' not yet understand,
why not to help a weak one or a falling man."
