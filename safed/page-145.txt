IT'S GETTING HARDER

Everybody has got one main aim,
A thing he needs to do.
Everybody has got one passion
and wishes that his dreams come true.

Bridge:
But your whole life long you can't go on pretending
that one day you will do what you really want.
And it's very hard to try to make an effort,
When everything just seems to work against you,
When you're alone.

It's getting harder to hold on to your dreams, while you're growing up.
Life's ruled by facts and there's no place for illusions,
Your time runs short.

Bridge

Refrain:
And so you got to get on fighting harder
for what you want to do.
You got to try to move mountains
and you should never give up trying.

Bridge

It's getting harder to hold on to your dreams while you're growing up.
It's getting harder to hold on to your dreams.
It's getting harder to hold on to your dreams, get to the top.
It's getting harder to hold on to your dreams.
