IMAGINATION                                1991
                                         (09.10.)
Light falls through the window
as I wake up to another day.
Tell me will I stay the same.
Unlike the birds in the trees,
being oh so noisy,
I'm unable to fly away.

Refrain:
Take me over mountains
and lead me through the valley.
Lead me to the promised land
in your imagination.
Don't you call me funny
and don't take me for a silly child.
I can't be no child any more, I know.

'Woke up late this morning,
cause I didn't go to sleep
last night, waiting for an idea to come
to tear me out of apathy,
increasing my believes.
'Woke up late this morning,
been talking to the mirror's face,
thinking 'bout the final place to be.

Refrain:
Take me over mountains
and show me how to fly high.
Take me to the final light
in your imagination.
I am close to find out
what happened to the silly child
that is no child any more.
