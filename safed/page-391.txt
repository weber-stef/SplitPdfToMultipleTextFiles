FLIP A COIN

Inside the water, in the light before you
It is that, which you do.
Though you don't understand it still makes perfect sense
makes perfect sense.

Everything you do
Everything you see
Inside your head
It's in your hands.

Refrain:
Don't you lose your way,
just cause you can't say
Where it will lead.
Open up your eyes,
Find the thing you need
Just flip a coin.

It is the past and it is that, which will be
A light inside the dark
And it is which you see
when you have your eyes shut tight
Lonely and desperate.
There's still so much that you have never even dreamed of
Inside your little world
And sometimes you wake up and
nothing's like it should be..

By the light of day
There is no easy way
