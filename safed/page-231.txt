IT TAKETH AND GIVETH

The lonely one is nobody's fool,
but still he's fooling himself.
So it just can't be the better way
to hide yourself away.

Refrain:
For love, it taketh and giveth you
and you just got to decide,
if what you want is the lonely way,
you want to live a free lie.

For love, it taketh and giveth you
and changes thinking and heart,
So you may try to live on your own,
or try to open your heart.

A girl, she loves and she hateth you,
depends on if she depends on you.
She might pick you up or push you down,
depends on, how strong you are,
