HANDS OFF

Put all this stuff away, let's get out of this.
I'm getting involved in it, not knowing, what it is.
I'd like to close my eyes, just being left alone.
Nothing to harm me, nothing ought to be done.

To me it seems I'm not to influence this.
Don't even know 'bout the thing, that I miss.
Just like to close my eyes to make it all fade.
Need something to tear me out, before it's too late.

Refrain:
I still remember those different days.
Nothing too strange or too far away.
'Seems everything changes lately,
Everyone gets old.
