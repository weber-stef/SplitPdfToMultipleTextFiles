KICKS

Filled glasses, burning joints,
seems there is many a way
to get yourself beyond plastic reality.

To fly high, avoid crying
takes a real kick anyway.
It's getting harder,
while you're getting old.

Bridge:
Time slips away
and you're in need of something
to lift you up
and make you see this world from high above now,
to make you see the world.

Refrain:
The wave to wash your troubles away,
The wind to make you fly where you long to be,
A kick to make you feel why you are,
A touch to make you see who you really are.

Loud laughter, your girl's kiss,
bright lights and screaming guitars,
things to surround and to shelter you,
Some good friends, some good talk,
exits to different worlds,
means to make you see, it's not in vain.
