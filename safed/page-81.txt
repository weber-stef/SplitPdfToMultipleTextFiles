SENSELESS WITHOUT YOU

Time passes me by as we are walking through the hours.
As I listen to your words, I feel love inside of you.
And I do hold it close, so deeply in my tthoughts.
And I know, who I am, as long as I'm with you.
Refrain:
I am just afraid, that soon our time will slipp away.
I'm only frightened, that the speed of hours
will be standing in our way.
You have said, you'd love me, You have said, you'd need me.
And I believe in you, I trust in you and I feel free through you,
But the time diminishes the sense of the words.
And it's the time, that makes hearts grow cold.
And I do not want to loose you.
Would be senseless without you.
Refrain
