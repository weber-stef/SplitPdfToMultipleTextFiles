SIGNAL TRACKED

Turn your head around, look at me baby,
Let me feel your eyes on me.
Like I had been waiting, tracking down your signal
discovery no option on my mind

Refrain:
Are you close, are you near me
Meet me at the worlds loneliest place
like all those lights in a dark sky
be with me, as long as we have fun

                      forevermore

There are seven billion (of us)
baby you are so hard to find
Could I help you discover me
We'll have fire and flashes, lightspeed ahead of us
Just give me a sign, where it's to be

Bridge:
Well honey I thought I found you before
you felt so good, felt so right.
shipwrecked on the giant ocean, far from the shore
drifted apart and out of sight
