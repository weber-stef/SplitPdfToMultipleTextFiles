CURE

I'll think the whole thing over when my head stops to turn
I'll be in that state that they always talk about.
I'll get my batteries loaded and then my mind cheers up
if that is everything it needs.

Bridge:
I look at where I am now
and I look at where I've been
It used to be so different
Tell me how many faces do you see
when you're looking at me?

Refrain:
Lead me out of trouble
Get me out of here
Give me a cure.

I lost my mind as lately I lost my confidence
I turn in circles and then start it over again
the harder I try (to) get out the deeper I'm stuck in
I'd love to change it all, just help me to begin.
