IF THIS IS LOVE

I think that you're running away and baby I think you're afraid.
You say you don't know about love and then you close your eyes.
And baby I'm unhappy now, since you have been leaving me
alone in a state I don't know
Refrain:
If this is love or something else.
So how can you go away now
and what am I supposed to feel about it
Baby will you ever read this lines
and will I sleep with you again?
Bridge:
It's driving me crazy while it calms me all down.
It's making me tired while it makes my pulse run.
I'm laughing with strangers and I'm laughing with friends.
Well I just don't like to be alone again.
Refrain
