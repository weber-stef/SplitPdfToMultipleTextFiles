LOST IN THE CROWD

When winter comes down as a sudden change,
As you start thinking and your mood gets strange,
As silence comes upon to get you down,
you might just think of a change.
Walls seem to come down to make you feel small,
Silently you scream, no one hears your call,
As minutes seem to be that endlessly,
and you're about to fall down,

Refrain:
Someone's to pick you up,

Though you may think, you live a senseless life,
far too much, against that you are to strive,
Think all those pressures surely get you down,
because you are still alone,

You are freezing for the cold inside,
You think you'll never pass those endless nights,
Think you're inferior, for you're still alone
and things are never to change.

Refrain

Bridge:
Someone's to pick you up,
if you just walk right out,
You're able to stay proud,
Don't you get lost in the crowd.
