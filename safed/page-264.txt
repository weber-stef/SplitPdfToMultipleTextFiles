VIOLENCE

And without a warning you are to face the evil fact
This time it might be you to lose your life.
Made to be thinking, men can be deaf, dumb and blind.
Distorted pictures in black and white.
Refrain:
Made to finally fade away
without a crowd to think back
anger's coming up in a simple mind.
Little simple gears that run out of control,
Trying to get important by taking lives.
Violence is breaking through.
Acting out of control.
And without a warning you are to face the brutal fact.
Could be your house burning, knife in your back.
So how are we to stop this, we don't believe in 'sense of fights.
But if you'll be my enemy, I'll beat you back.
Refrain
And without a warning you wake up late at night.
There's someone outside your home, throwing stones and fire.
Could be your sister burning, could be your brother, could be you.
The question to be asked is simply why.
