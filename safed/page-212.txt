WONDERING

Wind's thrown into my face, as I do leave the place,
which my eyes just recognized.
I'm wondering, still wondering 'bout life.
Never stop, times to come, river flow on and on,
paths don't you ever end.
Going ever on I'm wondering 'bout life,
Refrain:
Cause of anything, we do, things, we're still up to do,
There's still so much to look at left, there are colours right ahead.
As minutes drop right on, like water's coming down,
as clouds around us move, there's still so much to look at left,
still colours right ahead.
Life's got so many ways, imagine just nights and days
Don't your dreams seem that real to you sometimes?
And then you're wondering about life?
Refrain
