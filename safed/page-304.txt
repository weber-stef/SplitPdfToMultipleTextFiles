NERVESCRATCHER

It's only bubbles coming out of your mouth
it causes trouble to find out how to make sure without a doubt
you don't continue scratching on my nerves.
Well you're so bumptious yet you're ready to crawl
if just somebody called you the right man for the job.
( It's a dirty one, but someone's got to do it.)

Bridge:
So go on licking somebody else's shoes, go on telling
the truth bout your favourite oponents.
Someone like you will never give me the blues.
It will be far more you'll lose than you'll win.
Continue laughing at the Hungry and the Ill, cause in the end
you will still laugh along with your mirror.
So go on creeping till you forget how to walk.

Sometimes we argue but I'd rather just puke,
So let us just face the truth. There is no sense in talking.
You're scratching on my nerves.
It's only bubbles coming out of your mouth it causes trouble to find out
how to make sure without a doubt you don't continue
scratching on my nerves.

Bridge

Refrain:
Dumb sheep before the golden calf to clean the surface on behalf
You'll never understand me and that's why I'm so glad I'm like I am.
