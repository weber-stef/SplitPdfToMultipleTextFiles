BEYOND MISTRUST

Born into a world of glory and power,
he's anxious, what's coming on now.

He wanders through large halls of his fathers' house,
a world maintained by empty vows.

Lost in a state being accused by own tthoughts,
he doesn't ask himself, what to do.

He's drifting between moods and looking for some words.
A disease, that simply won't go.

Refrain:
He is looking for an answer,
he is waiting for a change.
He is shocked by his surroundings,
for the world around seams strange.

Dreams of a world, filled with passion and wonders
are within his head and still growing,

like the effect of time and the sense of his nightmares,
of whose existence he's knowing,

Within a world of suppression and curses,
he doesn't know, how to behave.

He knows, it's a hard world, he takes all to hard,
but he knows, there's a reason to live.

Refrain:
So he looks for further answers.
For a world beyond mistrust.
If he's doing it his own way,
he is sure, he won't be lost.
