NO CARE

Waking up, still puzzled by the night before,
Too many empty bottles, that I count.
This room is full of people that just feel the same.
Tell me, is this the paradise, we found?
Bridge:
Drinking and smoking to forget the night before.
Tell me is it paradise or hell. I am not really sure.
Tell me is it different with you, are you puzzled too,
or is it true that no one cares at all?
your whole life's wasted?
What do you do to your life
and the time that you have left?
