CLOSER TO YOUR MIND

Holding you close, it feels so different to me, I still don't know you now,
But whenever we kiss, it does feel good tome, baby, I feel amazed somehow.
Touching you gently and get closer to your mind is what I try to do.
Seems one thing I'm allowed to do, 'seems the other I am not.

Refrain:
Just searching for the right direction in a new relation now.
It's more than just a cheap attraction, to satisfy my heart and soul
I need more than just any action to satisfy me anyhow.

Having you here within a part of my life, still you're hard to handle.
Do you know, what you do? You seem to be strange to me.
'Can't get you off my mind.
I know, I've seen a lot, I've seen more things than you did.
My life has been unusual this far it seems it doesn't count at all.
You still push me into total confusion.

Bridge 2:
We, free to do, whatever we will want, we wonder, what we should do.
We, who are said to be ought to grow up,
wonder why we work together with an unknown spirit,
wonder what will work out of this game.

Bridge 3:
The more I get to know you, the more I get exited,
the less I see you through. The less I know, what to do,
The less I see it through.
I know, you're looking good, but that would not fascinate me
just like you do now. There is still something more;
Maybe just that I can't see you through at all.
