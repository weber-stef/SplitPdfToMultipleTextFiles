THE WAY YOU DID

Please, don't you do me no harm,
would you just go on and on
loving me like you do.
It was the right time for me suddenly,
when you walked into my life.

Refrain:
It was the time to rearrange me.
It was the time for me to change.
It was the day, for which I've waited.
It was a day to be remained.

For nothing else has changed
my life in the way you did.

Please, don't you leave me alone,
Would you just stay with me,
never letting me go.
A lot things have changed in my eyes,
there are no more lies,
since you walked into my life.

Refrain

Since nothing else has hit my heart,
in the way you did.
