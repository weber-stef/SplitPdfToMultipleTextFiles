SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW

When will you ever wake up to see, that there's still life around?
When will you ever believe, that there are reasons
to say, that we ought to, we ought to carry on?
When will you ever see, that there's a chance to go on safely.
Why do we have to disbelieve in the strength of our own tthoughts?
Why do we never ever see?
When will you ever wake up to see that there is still a place
for us and them and for you and me?
For all I know you believed in going on like we did.
This time around I begin to wonder, what you'd really like to do
For you a lifetime means nothing more than experience of pain and lies.
Why don't you tell us of your problems, if there's something we should know?
