DAY X

Some days with just opened eyes
I dig for deeper looks inside

I try to find somebody I've been.

My memories walk strays far away
to a place in time where I could say
I'd exactly know what I'm all about

And there wouldn't be a shadow of doubt.

Where am I now?

I was in love with bitterness,
the artist's love for his life's mess
Time should never break my heart's will

And as you see you're special day
won't come while time just fades away
the picture in your mirror looks strange,

somehow you just don't feel the same

Where are you now?
