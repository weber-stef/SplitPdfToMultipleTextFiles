ANDROGYNOUS BLUES

Androgynous and senseless, that's what I think about myself,
I feel as if it all changed, I changed my whole skin.
Nothing remains eternally, that's what they say about life,
but I would never have thought that I'd be that puzzled.
Refrain:
This far - I only know I am so lonely.
This far - I don't know how far I should go.
Friends say it ain't no problem, girls say that they're amazed,
but I am only confused - So nothing happens.
