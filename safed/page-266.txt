BELIEVES                                             1991
                                                   (30.11.)
If there was nothing but the sun
above a place I couldn't call my home,
I'd still move on, still holding on.

If I had nothing but a dream
inside this head of mine,
I'd still believe in this one way, one way to be.

Refrain:
You cannot tell my dreams from my believes,
'seems I'm walking a way no one can see,
This is myself, my only way to live.

So don't try to tell me, how to act.
There is a thing I see, and it's a fact,
the only one to change me is myself.

If I had nothing but the big sound
in my soul, under control
and coming from my heart, me being its part.

You would be looking in the eyes
that with no disguise
would tell you no lies
and I'd be the lucky one.

Do you understand?

Refrain

Bridge:
Open up your eyes or let it be.
Listen to me or leave me alone.
It doesn't even change a thing I do
for this is my life.
