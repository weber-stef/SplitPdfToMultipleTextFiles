LIGHTNESS, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

Never saw you like this before, I never saw an angel so bright,
the golden colour‘s beautiful and your smile‘s a gorgeous sight.
The sky is endless, lights so blue, like floating in a dream.
my eyes wide open I see you are running out on me.
Refrain:
Now it feels like lightness
feels like everything is well
but I know how much I‘ll miss you
as far as I can tell.
The night is black, my heart beats fast, my tthoughts spin in a loop
I fear my fear will eat me up, no matter what I do.
So when we both look at this thing we see it differently
I thought that there was something big, but that was only me
Refrain
