HEAVEN BOUND

Time flies, time flies

Well I just remember it was summer then
I knew her for a while but we had just been friends
gorgeous and funny and whenever we met,
we laughed a lot, we laughed a lot.

I had just gone solo and we met with friends,
smoking pot in the park, til the others left,
we went back to her place to talk about her boyfriend
and then it happened.

Refrain:
It's been a while, since I thought of her,
but her picture is all so clear to me,
She was taller than me, yet she was a perfect fit.
I knew, this wouldn't last and I felt puzzled and free.
When I touched that hair, when I kissed those lips,
touched that body while she moved those hips,
It was clearly obvious I was out of tricks, man I was heaven bound.

We heard her boyfriend's car, it was time to leave
quite in a hurry , just like a thief.
My had was spinning and my heart ran free, unforgettable.

Refrain:
It's been a while, since I thought of taht
but the picture is all so clear to me,
I don't think I was ever bound except heaven bound,
Nothing has really ment much to me
When I touched that hair, when I kissed those lips,
touched that body while she moved those hips,
It was clearly obvious I was out of tricks, man I was heaven bound.
