MONEY RULES

Even if you got no one, if you just got no friend,
even if you are someone not to care, just about whom you hurt.
There is still something that makes everyone like you
and that makes you be heard.
And you can walk along the streets with proud,
even though your whole life you just did wrong,
No one will point his finger at you and
There'll be no one to blame you
If you're just able to pay for every evil deed done,
there will be no one to harm you.

Bridge:
It's just a dangerous dream of former times
to demand that everyone should get what he deserves.
For if there's no exploitation of a lower class,
It gets impossible to earn more than just enough.

And so just go on exploiting and be sure, nobody really resists.
Even if one cried out loud, that he would revolt, you could even buy him.
And no one really gets out of this circulation, we're all too deep within.

For as long as the world will turn, cruelty will always succeed.
And you can trample down everything you dislike,
it's just your check book, that counts.
And you can buy yourself friends, you can buy a lover,
It just needs larger amounts.

Refrain:
As long, as the coins will shine the got the power to enslave you.
Money will cause hate, money will cause crime,
But it still will amaze you, money rules.
