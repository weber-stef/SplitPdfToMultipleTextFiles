TONY

1: “It isn't the first time, Tony left the house in the night,
I would like to know, what's going on.”!

2: “When night falls down on the silvery water, by the moonlight's
twilight shining, you'll begin walking without touching ground,
then that something with the wet shining für will come out of the
water and take you away. Be aware, Tony!”

3+4: “Henry?!” - “Where is Tony?” - “Haven't seen him”
“But the water's rising. He may got into the flood.”

1+2: “The paralisation of our souls will go on if we don't get up and
start to fight it. There's something evil hidden in each of us.
Maybe Tony has allready stepped over the border, Maybe, maybe
he won't ever come back.”

2: “I can hear the calls of crows, where there are none, I can hear
thunder, when it's silent, I can hear people cry and church bells
ringing. I think, there's something evil in the sound of the wind
outside. I know., ..

3+4: “Where are you now?”

2: “.. Tony won't ever reach this door..”

3+4: ”Where are you now?”

2:“.. again.”

3+4:“Where are you now» where are you now?”

1: “I once was told the oath, that when the cat cries in a stormy
night and a wolf is howling to the moon, the beast takes an
innocent human being with him and the gates of hell shut behind
them forever and ever.”

2: “Where is Tony? He's already been gone for such a long time!”
