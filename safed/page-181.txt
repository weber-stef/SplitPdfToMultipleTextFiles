LIKE PINBALL

To always try to get up, is what the game's about,
while all around lights shine.
The way up may be very steep and badly hard to go,
Try hard not to get smashed.
Refrain:
Don't just aim at what you want to get,
sense of game is just to have fun.
Don't just aim at what you want to get,
try to finish, what you've begun.
To always keep on moving is the aim of the game,
Trying to get things done right.
For you will have the best time,
being in permanent movement,
so just do keep right on.
Bridge:
So just try to get through all those hindrances.
'got to hit the triggers of those outstanding chances.
