STREET

When you are lonely and you just can't sleep
in the middle of the night
And when you stare inside the mirrors face
till the sun is finally up
Where are you now and where did you want to be
why do you never make it there?
Is everything good just a memory
fading away

Bridge:
When you are sad and desperate no way out
and everything just hurts
You just don't recognize that mirrors face
that ugly and small

Refrain:
Run into the dark
and look up to those stars
so many there to see
lights, light years away you cannot touch
But they're for you to see
Somebody out There's just waiting for you
you just have to go on
Open up your eyes and don't you just give up
I can understand..
