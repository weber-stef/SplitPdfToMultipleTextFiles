FEEL FINE

You - Why don't you move on over now,
Why can't you see that I somehow
need someone to understand,
giving me a helping hand?

Yes - You've got touch that wonderful,
start everything rising up high.
I need to feel you near,
I've got to have you here.

Please let me try it once,
I need to see you feeling confused
I just needed one more chance.
It's something you would not refuse.
You just do make me feel fine.

You know - I need to hear you laugh and sigh,
I need to be right by your side,
I love to watch each move you make,
I'd love to help you concentrate on

Me, I'd like to give you all I got,
it is a passion burning hot,
Deep inside of me,
I feel something rising up.

Please excuse me I can't hold back.
I hope that it does not come too fast.
I hope that you don't feel to attacked,
but I feel as if exploding yet.

You just do make me feel fine.
