TIME ITSELF

I've been thinking a lot girl, I've been thinking 'bout you,
wondering if you changed me with the things you do.
I've been so afraid girl, I've been so afraid.
Paranoid fear of getting old too soon.
Refrain:
'Seems I've been talking 'bout things I don't understand.
'Seems I've been talking about myself.
'Seems I've been talking 'bout worlds I never saw.
What is the effect of time itself?
I have taken drugs then to see with different eyes.
Yet, they just underline what you've got on your mind.
And time keeps on running, keeps on slipping away
And memories just reflect parts of what has been.
Refrain
Bridge:
I dream I finally wake up and it's all just been a dream.
There is no movement of time or any other thing.
Still I feel sweat on my hands, for there is nothing around
and there is hardly a sound but my own breathing.
I'd like to wake up again, I'd like to feel time again
I'd like to see you again.
Refrain
