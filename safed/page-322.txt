I DON'T KNOW

Like a fly that tries to get out through the glass
We try to get hold of company
that resists the temptation of leaving us when we fall down.
People say what goes around that comes around
everything you do falls back on you
Forgive me my ever changing moods because I don't know myself.
Refrain:
I don't know who'll talk to me then, I don't know who'll be with me,
I don't know who'll look in my eyes all of those nights and days.
Do we hold on tight to what we think we own
till we find out that we just pretend?
Please tell me the truth go tell me what to do
in case you know.
Refrain:
I don't know who'll be with me when I finally have to go.
I don't know who'll look in my eyes all of those days to come.
