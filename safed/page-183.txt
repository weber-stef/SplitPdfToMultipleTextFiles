CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER DAY

She handed me a cup of coffee
and smiled right in my eyes
That kind of tender smile,
that makes you feel warm.
I took her hand and kissed her gently,
warm showers all over my heart.
She put her arms around me
and we drifted in love's circles.
Seemed we could move that way
until the end of time.
It seemed as if I'd never get hurt again,
but it has been just a dream.

Bridge:
Where am I to find a gentle stranger,
to share all my dreams,
I often tried to find those friendships,
but it's been cold far too long.

Refrain:
Seems I can't wait another day,
though I just seem to fade,
the more I try to make my life a real one.
Seems I can't wait anyway,
though sometimes I even spend days,
just thinking bout the right way
to get straight on.
