SEASONS II - AUTUMN

The leaves are falling down again, the faces do look bored.
The suicide-rates rise again, storm's rising at the shores.
There are no pills left in the stores, people are in a bad state of health.
To relax a bit, I wanted Jacki tonight, but she just killed herself.
Refrain:
For it is autumn again. It' s getting colder all around.
It is autumn again. And green turns into brown.
The rain is pouring on the nerves, agression's rising up.
the frost turns loving into hatred, a storm is coming up.
For it is autumn again.
Me, I got a cold again, my clothes are all wet.
It's torture to look in a mirror, or to get out of bed.
Nobody seams to recognize that I feel that bad.
They just think about their own, little dirty problems
or they're already dead.
Refrain
Rain is pouring down on me and seams to drive me mad.
I am wet all over, I am, freezing and I'm sad,
for it is autumn again.
