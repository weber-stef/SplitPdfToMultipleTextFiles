EXPERIENCE

Expect:
Think or believe that something will happen or come,
that someone will come, wish for and feel confident
that someone will receive.
So you're in my head - Experience.
So you're in my head - Process of gaining knowledge or skill
by doing and seeing things; knowledge or skill so gained.
She's got red hair and she's not skinny.
It ain't simple, for she's not silly.
She used to be someone special when she used to be close to me.
Yet all of you have been different - Not that easy as it ought to be.
Refrain:
Run high when thinking about what you do.
Just run high when looking around what to do.
'Cause high hopes may powder you up yet you may see
that high hopes, they're never what they ought to be, yeah.
So you're in my head - So you're in my head.
Refrain
