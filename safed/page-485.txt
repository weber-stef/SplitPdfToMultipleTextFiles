UP AND DOWN

You are not here

Bridge:
My head spins, my heart runs, I don't know, where this is gonna end.
My head spins my head shakes, yeah, I don't know, where this is gonna end.
I don't know, where this is gonna end.

My head is out of trouble and my brain is out of town,
I don't recall no names, I'm swimming in indifference,
nothig left to be done the beat's alwaysl the same.
My body is my buddy and my conscience can't get tamed,
We are family, but my head runs away from us all.

Refrain:
Up and down, there are so many ways, all in all we're all the same.
"Just go on and find your way" - But me, I am lonely still.
Is this meant to be, is this how it should be?
Up and down, there are so many ways, must be a way for me

Yeah

SOLO

Up and down, there are so many ways, all in all we're all the same.
"Just go on and find your way" - But me, I' standing still.
Is this meant to be, is this how it should be?
Up and down, there are so many ways, so many ways ..

Just go on and find your way
Is this meant to be, is this how it should be?
Up and down, there are so many ways, so many ways ..

.. must be a way for me
