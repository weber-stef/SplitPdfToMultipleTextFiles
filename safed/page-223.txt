BUSTER

Buster's getting nervous, as the night begins
And he jumps out through the window of the room he's kept in.
He walks over the high roofs, his slim body is strong
he looks out for a night full of adventures to come.

Refrain:
And Buster lives in freedom, a feeling, he won't lose.
You can't force the instincts to fade, while the animal is still alive.
His body may get older, his thinking never will.
The cat may keep its claws in, but it never gets tamed.
Buster never gets tamed.

Inside the nights dark picture, beneath the pale moon's light
walks the creature, without knowing any fright.
And while its steps that smoothly seem not to hit the ground,
still it recognizes any movement around.

Refrain

Bridge:
If inside of you a free, wild heart still beats,
if you are willed to fight for things you need.
You feel a need to realize your dreams,
then you shouldn't ever disbelieve and give up.
Surely you'll be falling down sometimes,
bite the dust surrounded by bad signs,
but there's a power burning deep down inside you,
animal stamina to realize man's dreams.
