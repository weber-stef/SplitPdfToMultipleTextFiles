SMASH THE MIRROR

Open up this book, open your eyes and look inside,
Tell me what you see and talk about it.
I try to picture myself in a time, I left it all behind.
The only problem is I don't know the way
and you can't do this for me.
I smashed the mirror, because its picture was a fake,
'Need something different to reflect myself.
Refrain:
Itls hard to always be the one, who's misunderstood,
when it's your own mistake, self pity now.
You need to find out more about its meaning to you.
So you can fight self pity now.
I switched the lights off so it was easier to see.
I smashed the clock then so there was no time.
No one was listening so it was easier to talk,
And on the inside I felt a friend dying.
