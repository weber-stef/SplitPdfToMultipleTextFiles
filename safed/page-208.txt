INSIDE OF YOU

Sweet little lady, if you'd come a little closer,
we could surely find a topic, we could surely come to talk.
Just look in my eyes, for this moment, I look different.
There's a spark, that just caught fire, which is burning in my eyes.

Want to animalize
Want to animalize with you.

Come on girl, move towards me like a wild cat.
I am not afraid of your claws, yet are you afraid of mine?
Just want to touch you, want my tongue to get to know you,
to explode inside your fire, while I'm looking in your eyes.

Want to animalize
Want to animalize with you.

Bridge:
Want to melt inside of your heat,
surely we'd find the fitting beat.
Lead me inside of you.
Want to kiss all over your face,
want to fall in a sweet, hot rage
Lead me inside of you.

Sweet little girl, just creep on all over my body.
Go on teaching me a lesson 'bout the secrets, that you've got.
I want to find out, just how forceful your body is.
Whether you are going to make me scream or I will make you sigh

Want to animalize
Want to animalize with you.

Bridge

Refrain

Want to explore you, get to know you,
just want to feel the inside of you.
