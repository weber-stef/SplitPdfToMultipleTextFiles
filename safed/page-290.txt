BEFORE YOU CAME

Won't let you change all my memories,
don't want to hear about yours.
You've always been a part of me, but not the biggest part.
It's okay with me when I cry, it's alright if I don't.
' Don't hope you'll be my psychiatrist,
'Not even sure, what I hope for.
Refrain:
'Seems that you leave the same way you came.
'Won't let it change what life means to me.
Don't take away all my memories, for they do belong to me.
'Don't need your advice on how to behave
the next time, I'll fall in love.
I love this picture I have of you
And no one takes that away from me.

I still live on in the place we shared,
but yet - to me it has changed.
I try to find just what's mine, all mine
before you came and now again.
I see - I may be wrong but I do believe
my life just happens to me.
So it doesn't even matter if I'll cross your way

You didn't stay, so here I go again.
Refrain
