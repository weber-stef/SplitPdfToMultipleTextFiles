LADY LUST

„Call me Lady Lust ", she said as she was looking into my eyes.
„My father is the instinct and my mother is the earth.
Can make you kneel before me, but can also make you
feel so strong ; However you may look at it,
you are under my control."
Bridge:
" Even brother Mind can't tame me ;
no one to take that spell off of you.
I'll be the heat inside your body,
I will be creeping inside you.
So watch out for Lady Lust. "
