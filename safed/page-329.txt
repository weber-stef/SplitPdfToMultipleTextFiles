SHARK FISHING

My head is all messed up, I just can't keep calm
Your picture's in my head and my stomach
You're everywhere but you're just too far away.
Your eyes they can smile, they're closed when we're kissing
You've let me take your hand as we walked around
You're everywhere like it had always been.
Refrain:
I am kind of nervous, sort of losing my head
but I know there's no easy way out.
I got my mind made up I am dreaming about you
and I want to have you around me
So I see light again.
All wrapped up in silence my heart beats like crazy
An idea of you covers everything
Come home into my arms as if forever more.
Refrain
Bridge:
Give me all your laughter, your friendship and your lust
cause it's you here in my head
Join me through all the sentiments of your life, caressing me
