A CHANGE OF STYLE

Looking back on your life, why does it mean to you
just to look back in hatred and fear?
Why do you take your past as a part of your life,
that you'd like to be forgotten now?
Everything that you do and each step that you take
brings you closer to the end of your life.
So why just run right on, trying to forget what you did wrong,
don't you think you just betray yourself?

I think you should not change your style without knowing why,
but it's high time to find out, who you are.
Stand up for what you want, cry out for what you need,
otherwise you won't get far.

I know it's easy to feel perfect, but you can't go like this
and you being critical with yourself is what I miss.
I got the impression my talk makes you feel confused,
but there are several ways of living and you now got to chose.

But you seem to be afraid to do the first step.
But if you don't start now, you'll get caught in a time trap.
I know, I can't tell you, what you should do.
It's just an impression of yours,
I just want to make you see that it ain't that useful just to flee,
whenever there's a problem.
Remember I am still your friend and I don't want it now to end
I just want to lend you my helping hand, so don't you turn your back on me.

You better Look back.
