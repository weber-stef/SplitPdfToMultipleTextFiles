DEAR PADRUGA                              1992
                                        (29.09.)
She's always beside you,
when you pick up your guitar.
She's with you, when all systems fail,
we never are apart.
Refrain:
Dear Padruga's there,
when everybody else leaves you
and you're down and out.
She's a god given present,
here to guide you through the
past and through future times.
Dear Padruga saves you
from the danger of boredom
and the breakdown stops.
She's a real nice girl,
a real good friend to have.
She puts the note inside my head.
I hope that it never stops.
She makes me see distorted beauty,
she takes away the lock.
Refrain
