BLUE LONELY NIGHTS

Now that I live my life separately, now that my girlâ€˜s gone;
Now I've just got too much time, I don't now where I'm going to.
Now I wake up much too early, don't know, what to do.
I'm in need of a kind kind of woman to stop me feeling blue.

Bridge:
'cause I'm in a strange kind of mood,
I just can't get used to live alone.

Now that I wake up all alone, nobody by my side,
days are not that interesting, neither are the nights.
And between my fingers all my dreams just slip away.
In doubt about my mind, I don't believe in what I say.

Bridge

Refrain:
I must admit, I turn in circles now.
I need someone to hold me tight and treat me right.
'Cause it feels boring to just do talk to yourself.
And it's hard to stay alive all through these blue lonely nights

Now that I spend my time running around, searching for thrills in my life,
looking for little things worth to run for,
I try to get somewhere, I never arrive,
Friends do think I'm very strange and do smoke too much.
Girls, I met say I'm obtrusive and do avoid my touch.

Bridge:
'cause I'm in a strange kind of mood,
I just can't get used to live alone.
