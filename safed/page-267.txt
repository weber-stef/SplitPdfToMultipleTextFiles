ALL BY HEART

I am all fed up with up with important words
'don't need to shout out to prove that I understood.
I don't need advice I didn't ask for.
'Got small talk with my former friends - formalities.
Why don't we try to see?
All is change, nothing stays the same.
Changing face - Changing self.
Just like everything was shrinking underneath fake gold.
We uphold our castles while our roofs come tumbling down.
Exchanging all our mirrors for the pictures of our past ;
so nothing ever changes, changes.
Refrain:
Why do you talk to me as if you learnt it all by heart?
You try to see someone that I have never been.
Look me in the eye and take it as a sign from me to you.
