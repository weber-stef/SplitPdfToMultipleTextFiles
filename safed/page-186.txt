MAN STUMBLES

As horizons finally fade at the tension's highest grade,
we may finally realize, what we have done.
As it's finally much too late, at all life's final gate, we may finally realize.
Bridge:
The power of our fault shall cause disaster and destruction.
No shield will be a shelter to us.
No force will help us to fight, or even just to face it,
There'll be no sun to lead us a way.
Refrain:
Man stumbles and he might as well just fall.
Fled on the highest mountain top, we won't be able to stop
our world from burning down, loss of our crown.
There'll be nothing left to love, neither below or above,
'cause there won't simply be a thing not burning.
Bridge
