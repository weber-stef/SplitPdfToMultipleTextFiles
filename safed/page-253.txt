POOR SUSAN

Susan knew something was wrong with her whole life,
as she recognized that the breaks failed.
The breaks of this new car, she'd got from her new star,
new gigolo she sort of bought.
But now while she fell down next to the Serpentine road
watching the ground Coming close.
She thought back on her life and it cut like a knife
glass splinters all over her face.

Susan she died and she came to a big gate,
where she had to wait for somebody who'd judge
her whole life, yet who'd judge his wife too,
'cause he had once been oh so dumb.

And laughing in her face not talking of disgrace,
he just listened to all her little lies.
For she started crying senselessly denying,
that she'd ever done anything wrong.
Bridge

But he said
Come on my sweat dear, don't you waste your sweat tears
I'd never do you any harm.
I remember your kiss I remember your wish
to always catch all of life's charms.
You are too young to die and
so I wonder why I shouldn't just let you go back.
You'll be back in your car and you won't remember
a thing that has happened up here.
Drinking the red wine looking in her stars eyes
she suddenly felt oh so dizzy
and then she fell down hearing only the sound
of a young man's and young woman's laughter.

Oh Susan - Pity the foolish ones.
