GUY- THE WALK

I'm an animal, I'm the big plan, I'm the eye that looks from above.
I am moving, I am breathing, I am inside the strange land.
I am looking for a first trace of the way that I should go,
Yet for something hidden in the inside.
Refrain:
And I can feel the presence of a thing I can't explain
And I can hear the call that comes from the inside of me.
I 'm an element of the forest and the light that makes the life
I move forward just as if I was moved I can feel you are inside it.
And I know I am to act, I'm to find out, I'm to look out right now.
Refrain
