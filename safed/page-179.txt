YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH

Open up your eyes!
Keep on walking, though you'd might like to run.
Keep calm, just don't you get too exited.
Life's sense, it could be oh so different,
from what you have ever thought it would be.
Bridge:
When everything around just feels so blue,
and you don't know exacly what to do,
it's time to take a stand and hold your head high.
Refrain:
So don't give up, you've just got one try.
And laughter sounds better than apathic sighs, all of those sighs.
Bridge:
You shouldn't think, it will be easy to live your own life,
but you should try to not give up to soon.
In any year, there comes a season of hard rain and of ice,
but there's always a place to lick your wounds.
