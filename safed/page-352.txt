RUNNING ON BLINDED

I thought that I had found, after all this time just thinking
The read thread, the method to my life
Alright at least I was about to hit its core.
The answer lay in you or it might as well be myself
Well, finally we'll never ever know
The truth changes her looks permanently.
Bridge:
You're thinking it all over until finally
you can't remember a thing
And everything you find out makes you doubt your brain
You concentrate your search on your little life
compared to the rest of the world
A little ant surrounded by zillions alike.
Chorus:
Running on blinded through bright light you'll never know
Your brothers and sisters that surround you they run too.
So if someone accidentally crosses your way open up your eyes
Start kissing in the bright light before you're running on.
