EASY JUST TO SAY I LOVE YOU

Something changes, when you walk into the room,
Somehow it all feels filled up
with the air of something really special,
that I like to smell alot.

Bridge:
But still I am waiting
for a look of those eyes,
or a word or two.
And still I'm not quite sure,
just what I should do

Refrain:
Easy just to say I love you.
Important is just what you do.
Easy just to say I love you
But still I don't know, who to do,
don't know just what to say to you.
I'd rather live on, having you by me.

Something is between us,
that I'm not to remove.
It just depends on you.
But if I was him,
I neither would just let you go.
So what am I to do.

Bridge
