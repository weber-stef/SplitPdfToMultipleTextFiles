LUCKY

It feels much better, than ever before. It is intensive.
It gets me down to the floor and it gets me up again.
Maybe it will be the same thing nevermore, just compromises,
or it won't make me turn, turn around.
It might not thrill me then.
Refrain:
I am beyond the fact of time again. I am over the borderline.
There is here no relief of bad times and it is not even on my mind.
I'm walking in a very bright light again,
It is amazing, so amazing.
Although a strange kind of a feeling, I do like it a lot.
