SEASONS IV - SPRING

It was the time, all life did start again.
I walked right out in the morning dew.
And I felt nature grew from day to day,
got to know things, I never knew.

Bridge:
Nothing still kept under cover
of the deep dark night.
Opened eyes realized life's circles
and everywhere around was light.

Refrain:
'Cause it was spring time again,
felt like it told you then
It's life's main intention to never give up.
It was the time, my force awoke again.

A life just can't be ruled by doubts.
It's good to learn by falling down again
if you can still be sort of proud.
