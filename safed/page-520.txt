DREAMCONTROL

It just keeps repeating itself
Dreams are out of control
Something always goes wrong
Heard a song just the other day
and I guess what it meant to say is
Maybe we will get it done
if we just concentrate

Refrain:
And you and me then we will fly
or we will run and the world flashes by
You are with me, you don't want to leave
and I get the real you finally

The bill has been paid, the door has been locked.
I dressed up all tidy and got done alot.
I ate something healthy made up for time lost.
You would be proud of me,
I you were interested in me.

Refrain:
And you and me then we will fly
over burnt wasteland passing by underneath
I hold you close, you hold my hand
I can see you within a dream
where will you go?
