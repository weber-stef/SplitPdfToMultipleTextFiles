STILL IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH

There's a chain, that holds him back again.
It's the ring around his finger.
Like he's captived in magnetic fields,
he's secluded from real life.
There's a thing, that makes her cry again,
but to tell him she still lingers.
Like she'd know, what he is thinking of,
his look cuts her like a knife.

Refrain:
Love's gone, long ago.
Love's gone away with time.
The feelings faded far away.
And now, there's only crying.

There's something making her depressions worse.
It's the look in lovers' eyes.
The look, she once had in hers too, when it all began.
One day, they may feel the same as her,
but yet none of them's lying.
He thinks "While they're about to start yet,
we're already at the end"

Refrain
She just wants to live a secure life,
not destroyed by deep - hearts' problems.
She just wants to live her daily life,
for she knows, it's tough enough.
He is sure, he does not love her,
still he knows, that he is used to
live beside her and never letting know,
what he is thinking of.
