NOWADAYS

Nowadays it's not that easy
to get something for a realistic prize.
You need large amounts to just get something,
you've had cheaper before.
Nowadays it's almost normal,
that you'll get in trouble soon,
while you're looking out for something easy.
It's five minutes past noon,

Refrain:
Nowadays no one knows nothing 'bout the truth.
And by yourself you don't know what to do.
No one can tell you nothing 'bout your future.

As I'm looking into your eyes,
as I kiss and hold you tight, I know
there's nothing deep between us,
strange kind of a delight.
These are strange times and strange relations,
no feelings are to be involved.
We got to avoid lover's problems,
they're not easy to be solved.

Refrain

Bridge:
And so now, here am I.
It 's hard but still I try to get what I desire
while I am still young.
