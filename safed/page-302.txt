WALK ON WATER

Waves all across the black sea, there's been wind in my face.
And I almost walked on water, you know.
I could taste the salt on my lips and a yearning in me
as I watched the black horizon and sky.
Refrain:
I was way up in the black sky ; I was there I was here.
'Seemed nobody else around went that far.
I've been following an unseen line, though I didn't move at all
And I'd never ever thought I'd get so far that soon.
'Seems the scenery isn't changing, In my dreams I returned.
And some times along the way I almost found out
where the place is, I should go to and what my eyes fail to see.
and I almost walked on water, you know.
Refrain
Bridge:
Should I really go down to where it's dark?
have I heard that sound or was it only my tthoughts?
Did I really lose the connection to reality?
Have I caught a glimpse of what they call infinity?
