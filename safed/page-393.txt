GIRL

When your whole body speaks to you
“just leave it, let it go!”
You feel a pain inside your chest
“just leave it, let it go!”
Hold on close to me, girl, for now it's true.
Hold on close to me, girl, I am with you,
Are you with me?
When your hole body speaks to you
“just leave it, let it go!”
A world's been turning upside-down
and you don't know, what to do.
Hold on close to me, girl, for now it's true.
Hold on close to me, girl, I am with you,
Are you with me?
I want to hold your body oh so close to me
I want to feel your body's warmth all over me
And I want to touch your face while you are next to me
And I want feel your long long hair like rain all over me.
