THE RECEIVE

Have you ever seen friendships, fading away within time,
becoming senseless, just laying heavy on the back of your mind.
Has there ever been some friend, cheating you in a way,
you had never expected, not knowing, what you're to say.
Bridge;
How can I just hold right on to things I never believed,
if a cry doesn't even count, but just the answers you receive.
Refrain:
There's been permanent changes in the life, I do live.
I have gone many a way, but I can't always just give.
So what am I to do now, how am I to behave.
Seems life's just a big circle, carrying me on its waves.
Where will I go to?
