SCREAMING OUT ON MAIN STREET

Well, I'm sure, it won't be long,
you'll hear it out on main street.
Screaming, for a special something
is headed out to roll.
Well, I'm sure, that one day soon,
you'll hear them crawling out on main street
And their hearts are filled with hate,
that continuously has grown.
Refrain:
There will be something all around us,
there'll be panic in the streets.
there'll be heat, that simply rose,
screaming out on main street.
Well, I'm sure, there is no way to stop it out on main street.
And I'm sure, there'll be not one chance left to get away.
For I know we're hold within this crazy world of trouble.
For I know it's our fault and we will finally have to pay
