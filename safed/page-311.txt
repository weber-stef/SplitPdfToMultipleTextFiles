DIARY

I take aspirins like sweets, smoking dope to calm my needs,
while my life passes me by like an unreal dream.
I got porn to share my bed, yet a hole inside my head.
And I hope this will be over before life begins.

Refrain:
You might strip it down to what you think it is.
So that I might laugh bout your analysis.
“Doctor” can't you see, you're not too close to me.
You just picture me inside a self made frame
You better smash it!

'getting me down, getting me down, living inside of a diary.
I can't see it through, what am I to do to start it all over again.

Refrain

Bridge:
Open up your eyes, lead me home.
It must be you who sees 'cause it's been you and me,
you are inside my diary.
Can you picture that nobody understands you.
Somebody who loved you hates you now?
Wake up and talk to me.
You seem so dead and gone as if it all was wrong
I didn't mean to hurt you, babe.

Inside my arms I try to warm your body,
I put a kiss on your sweet quiet lips,
I watch your face which seems incredibly tired,
come wake up dear and read my diary.
