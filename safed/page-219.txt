DANGER

As she was walking out the notary's office door,
there it stood before her red and shining.
And on its white seat lay a letter that did say:
" .. just a l i t t l e present from the one who loves you"
So she had not been wrong no longer was alone,
she's found somebody who loves her truly.
Husband and wife as them sharing each little thing.
Sharing their dreams, their feelings and her money.

Refrain:
And so she started off in the new cabriolet,
speeding home towards her one and only.
To fall right in his arms, be safe from every harm
To be protected from the danger that wealth causes.

The car, it gathered speed, her yearning did increase
just to get home into her mansion
to her beloved one, who'd share the time to come,
who'd stay right by her side through good and bad times.

Now she was oh so sure, his love for her was pure.
It wasn't true that he just loved her money.
A smile was on her face and she started to race,
for she just couldn't wait for his sweet kisses.

Refrain

A l l of a sudden then, she saw the gardeners' van
who'd stopped cause of those lost red roses.
So she stepped on the breaks and realized they failed
and then she recognized the danger that wealth causes.
