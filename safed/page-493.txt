SPECTRE OF MEN

Religions fall, states crumble, - left on your own merits.
No one will think or judge for you.
Ideas crawling inside your head of your bright beginnings.
It's not your fault the world has changed its ways.
Bridge:
You don't mean harm, you work for the good in us.
You know what I need, you just had no time to talk
- to me.
Refrain
The essence of men, the spectre of men
the spectre of men you have thought it out.
You don't need questions, you don't need doubts,
born with instant understanding,
Cause someone wrote it down for you long ago.
Everything that shall or shall not be is on your favourite pages.
Don't you read the rest, cause you might change your mind.
Bridge
Refrain
Even heaven fits somewhere in here,
Don't pretend you understand eternity.
You better just live, you better just breathe
You better just speak right now - we are here.
