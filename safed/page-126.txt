TREMBLING FOR FEAR

Can't you hear me calling you throughout the whole forest,
Answer me, where are you now?
I'm frightened by the sound of the trees in the wild wind.
I'm shocked by each thunderbolt, crashing down on me.

Where are you now, Why do you hide now,
is there something inside you,
I never discovered?
Please do tell me, if I can help,
I'll do everything, to get us out of this.

Bridge:
"I think I better go now, it's very late.
I will come back for the night then, you don't have to wait.
Don't you tell no one that I was here,
It's better for you, not to see it through.
I have to go now, there's nothing, you can do."

Refrain:
Maybe some day in a better time, we'll meet again,
If our minds are free of secretly acting orders, that we can't resist.
Maybe some day in a better time, when we can speak out loud,
I'll catch a glimpse of you again and we can meet without
Trembling for fear.

Can you see those crows, flying all above us,
Are they here for you, what kind of secret do you have?
Why are you that afraid of each bright light,
can't stand the city's heartbeat, don't speak out your name?
Is there any reason for you to keep calm now,
hiding in the shadows of your own life?
Why can't you explain to me the sound of your heartbeat,
that sounds a bit like a machine to me?

Bridge:
"I'm far away from you now, but still, I love you.
I can't help to leave you, it's much too strong!"
