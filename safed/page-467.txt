SO SAID THE ROBOT

And there you are and you dare to come over to me
to talk to me, be close to me, yeah right, close to me.
And those big eyes, and those sweet lips
seam to bore a hole inside my head.
Your body's magnetic fields disturb me.
Bridge:
I am not here to share my life with you.
and I am not here to tell you, what to do.
I am just here to share a bed with you.
We're of a different kind, You are the loving kind.
Refrain:
In love feels like being sick, so said the robot
and I think, he was right
believing in nothing at all.
Just cause you're here with me,
that don't mean nothing,
and I won't break for you
I believe in love nevermore.
I am not here to share my life with you.
and I am not here to tell you, what to do.
I am just here to share a bed with you.
You are the loving kind.
