WHERE DOES IT LEAD ME TO

Something's going wrong since I met you at the border,
Something moved.
I used to use my head, I used to be aware of what I did.
I used to be aware, I used to use my head,
the way I didn't do then, when you came along.

Bridge:
I've been fooled by you, baby didn't you see me, but
I've been crawling back to you.
Where does it lead me to? Where does it lead me to?
Where does it lead me to? Where does it lead me to?

Bridge:
You came along and got me out of my control.
You came along and cut me off my past.
You came along and got me off my way.
You came along, so I just went astray.

Bridge:
Strange - Just you take me into trouble, out of time
and you'll see me come around.
Strange - Just you tear me out of my past out of my time
I don't know where I am going.
Strange - Just you tear me out of my past out of my time
You take me off my way.
Strange - Just you pushed me far away from what I feel to be right,
what I feel to be right.
