EVERY MAN KILLS

It‘s just another way to get the thing done wrong
Man destroys the thing he loves.
Never ending trouble, this is way too dumb
I just can't seem to make it stop.

All my life, it seems I'm running, almost gone,
Following what I can‘t see.
And when I‘ll find my destiny I will run on,
leaving it all behind me.

Refrain:
We suffer since we love.
Or is it just because we do?
I love you even more
the less that you love me.

Another of those days that my eyes open up
to see that it's too dark to see.
the monster that I run away from it is here
keeps lurking deep inside of me.

Bridge:
Again and again and again
I was asking for a little more light
you finally switched the knob
and too much colour flashed in my eyes.
Still on the wrong way
looking for a thing that is true
Revolving endlessly
I love you.
