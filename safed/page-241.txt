SCHIZOPHRENIA

Simon's got different faces
He ain't always the same
Some people might think he is crazy.
Some people might think he's insane.
He has heard all of those warnings
Those things might turn you upside down.
Still he changes
while he's running out of time.
Refrain:
Schizophrenia creeping inside.
All those different colours, all those different lights
