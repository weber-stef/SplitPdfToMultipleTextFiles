ALL OF A SUDDEN

Sometimes I'm thinking back
to the times, when we were close,
The world felt different,
depending on what we chose to do.
None of us seemed to fade,
standing next to the other one,
Seemed we had a world to change,
if we wanted to.
Refrain:
But all of a sudden then,
things can change a lot.
You're left alone, still standing tall.
But it is much more fun
to be strong together,
you don't feel nothing of a fight.
It is always the same,
nothing good lasts long.
Again you're on your own
and you've got to be strong, that strong
I'm getting harder still, but what am I to do.
Think I'm not to be blamed,
though you may not get through to me.
Refrain
