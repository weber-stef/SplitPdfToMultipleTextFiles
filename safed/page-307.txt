CAPTAIN IGLO

Heading out to find another Seelachsfilet,
his beloved frozen ones,
being aware of the possibility of death,
unaware what foes might come.
All the loving women and the younger kids
wave a very last goodbye,
while a brave man heads out just with a few kids
to bring us what we desire.
Refrain:
Captain Iglo is on his way. Just a hero nowadays.
He is on his quest to find the final fish,
freeze the beast to feed those desperate kids.
And he thinks back to his selfmade fishing - rod,
the one his father made.
