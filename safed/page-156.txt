TO MEND A BROKEN HEART

There are a few ways to mend a broken heart,
there are a lot of things to start with now.
That is what it's all about.
You got to think straight, that's what it's depending on,
Got to find out what "right" and "wrong" do mean to you.

Bridge:
When your braings filled up with emptiness,
whenever your soul is shaking
Might change your life yourself, might just follow,
depends on what choice you're taking.

Cause in a few days you can change a lot,
might change all the principles you've got right now.
They might be unimportant then.

For in a few ways you can light up your heart,
possible to change tthoughts you have.
That is what it's all about.

Refrain:
Red lipstick on a pillow's white sheet,
waking up in a room that is not yours,
Looking out of foreign bathroom windows,
don't you care bout what time does,
'Cause time works out things on it's own,
in a special way.
Yes, time works out things on it's own,
in a special way.

You've got a few ways to go.
