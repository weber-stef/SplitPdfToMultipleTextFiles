CONFUSED

I pushed my hand against the heavy wooden door
and walked into the room, filled up with dust and mystery
I raised my head and saw a single spot of light and mesmerized
I moved on as if I was moved.
Refrain:
I didn't run away for cover.
I didn't think of any harm.
Neither understood.
I was mesmerized, could not keep calm.

Then something tore me to the centre of the room,
just like a puppet, being moved by something it can't see.
Like I was blinded, I was walking straight ahead.
over the chessboard, just a figure being moved.
Refrain
Bridge:
It made me feel confused.

Right in the centre of the room, beneath the light,
I opened up my eyes, but everything was turning round.
And I looked down and recognized all that black squares
they weren't real they were just deep, deep holes.
