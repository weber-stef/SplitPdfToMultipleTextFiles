TO THE NOBLEWOMAN

Am I to hide away, close my eyes
paying for a life so open minded?
Am I to run away, covering up again?
Or should I just move on to where I long
and reach out for your hand now?
Well, any way, that I choose,
there's always someone crying.

Refrain:
Is it the same with you,
You are feeling that badly true?
An' no matter, just what you do it puzzles you,
every little thing puzzles you?

So, if I moved right on,
to where I long,
how should it change,
what will be?
I'd rather run around,
than having no real try.
Than just do hide away,
a single day to far off from life's circle.
For a bit longer I'd
just like to turn around, turn around...

So why shouldn't we move on closer
to what we yet not know?
Don't just reach out for something easy,
this could be pleasant too.
