FAITH

I tried to remember your face,
but I can't make it out no more.
seeing through frosted glass
It's just like hands had touched my faith
before I even realized
They would fade again.
Bridge:
Nobody knows where all that mystery has gone
Nobody knew right then who he would become.
It's not just that you lose it, it's that you fail to hold on
They won't give back a day you have lived.
Bridge 2:
And as all of you faces
make up a final one
Still I really don't know
what else I should have done.
But there must be a reason
for the plan to go wrong
Well I'm used just to believe in faith.
