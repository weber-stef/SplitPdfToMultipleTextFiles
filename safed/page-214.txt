SHE

She looks for signs from her watchtower,
she waits for something to move.
And she somehow feels so frightened
as the night falls down.
There is that forest around her
and though she's far away yet
She feels afraid of it somehow.
It looks that misty and sad.

Refrain:
And there is something to move her.
To linger right in her head.
And there's a yearning to hold her like a spell
And though she goes on pretending
that she is safe behind walls,
she knows that something will never let her go.
And she's afraid, afraid somehow.

And as the night burns in daylight,
she acts that bravely again.
And she holds her head right up
into a clear, blue sky.
And there is no one to see her
the way, he'd seen her last night.
For she's got two different faces,
Doesn't even lie.
