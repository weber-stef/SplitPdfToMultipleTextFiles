GOING WRONG

I lost my head, I lost all control
over what's happening to me.
Nothing that I ever thought of
hasn't been changing.

Refrain:
And I think that I've been going wrong this time.
I think that I've been going wrong
about myself and what's been happening to me.

It's hard to be that close to you
because it is not the same.
I'd be your brother, be your friend,
but I would go insane.
