SOMEBODY ELSE BUT YOU BABE

There's been a lot of trying and trouble in my life,
I used to run around.
I used to be stumbling, when I walked alone.
You became my companion for a part in my life,
shared a bit of my time.
I don't blame you for going, I just do not care for you any more.
Refrain:
Maybe I'm still waiting for somebody else,
but you babe to return to me.
Bridge:
To give me different point of views, to make my heart grow warm,
to open up her soul and let me in, giving me love again.
There's been a lot of fooling going on, I had to learn a lot.
There was a lot of growing going on.
I had a love so exiting, once so long ago
that it felt too hard to be lonely, just then when I met you.
Refrain
Bridge 2:
Give me some love again, give me some hope.
And although it will stay a dream, it helps me now,
just to face things, too hard to get through them alone.
I'm not just living in memories, I just like to think back, being sure,
I would do it all once again.
