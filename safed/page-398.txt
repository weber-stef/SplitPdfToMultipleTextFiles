DANCE

Come on, pretty baby, just dance with me
Look at me, I shiver and shake
Far too many people here, I just want you
Come on, come to me.
Your hips are shaking and your shirt's so tight
I am losing my mind.
Come on, pretty baby, kiss me, kiss me
Don't treat me unkind.

Refrain:
I love watching you
Dancing just for me, girl.
To see your body moving
And you looking back at me
