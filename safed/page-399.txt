NO TURNING BACK

There is no way to understand it all
All the things you see.
Some things you can't comprehend unless you close your eyes
It is that which you feel.

Bridge:
In your dreams it all was different
Your very world turned and took you with it
Opening up your eyes
As you dreamt.

And like a wild and raging river time is running by
You watch it from the bank
And as you move into the water
It takes a hold of you
Who knows where it will end

Bridge

Refrain:

A spark in darkest space
Awake in a dreams embrace
What has been and what will be
This is your world and your time to be
Move onto the unknown land
Your life it is in your hands
In bright light or in the black
Let yourself go, there's no turning back
