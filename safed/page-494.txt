THE BIGGEST

Here I am, I'm selling myself cheap,
A horrible cheapskate, running out of time.
Too many questions spinning in my head,
I race against myself, so I can never win.

Refrain:
No reason just drifting, no vision on my mind,
digging up the dirt it ain't cool,
You will end up being the fool, it gets you nowhere.
If there's no beginning, how come there is an end?
I starts with an idea, they say it starts with an idea.

They won't come to your door
to tell you, you're the biggest, the brightest, the best.
She won't knock you over your head
to drag you in her bed and make sweet love to you.

Refrain

Bridge:
Could tell your laughter in a million
the two of us went for a ride
But our tommorow never happened
and there was no shelter in sight.

Here am I, I race against myself,
so I can never win.
