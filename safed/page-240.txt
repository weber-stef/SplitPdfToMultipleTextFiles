MY HOUSE

Are you afraid of the beautiful things we could do
This world's too absurd to be understood or to be true
Come to my house!
Show you how to fly, I'll take all your sorrows
away from you.
I'll make your eyes shine
and I'll take all those hands off of you.
Come to my house!
Refrain:
I am here to put it in your brain.
To you it's too hard to explain.
You're just a part of what I will create.
Seems I could be the hand of fate-
I'll change all your ideas, I'll change
what I don't like 'bout you,
Until you're depending on me,
asking me what to do,
Come to my house!
You cannot point the finger on me now.
Vou cannot change this will of mine
