MYSTERIES TAKE TIME

Every day here seems like an eternity, I don't want this food anymore
And this face next to me; in the end I won't know no more
The waves they hit the rocking boat, but I have this cup here on me
So I will save the sinking ship

Bridge:
This compass I have bought second-hand
don't exactly know how it behaves
This is northbound, this is westbound we're going straight ahead

This picture I painted all by myself I have another one here with me
case you don't see a thing, It's a mystery, takes time
The cook has talked music, but I don't know
how much more it is I can take
It's a rocky boat, it's a shivering world

Waves hit the battered ship
Like purgatory of water wind, this is southbound

Refrain:
Above me all the big waves, better bring all my stuff inside
The books said nothing bout it, this shouldn't be real life
The sun, it is all the way up, Horizon is glittering
There is no doubt she looks gorgeous, she is round and bright and mean

Above me all the big waves, better bring all my stuff inside
The books said nothing bout it, this shouldn't be real life
I certainly would save the world, if I just had my tools on me
This way's southbound

Horizon so glittering
