DON'T LET FEAR CONQUER YOU

I've got some news for you:
It's just depending on the kind of glass,
you're looking through, breaking through thin, thin lines.
It ain't always easy, just to find out why
you're either happy or do want to cry,
for it just seems much too extreme.
Refrain:
Wind blew hard from gigantic mountains,
as I wondered through that valley.
But the rains drops coming down on the stone made crowns
cleared off all the mist that still was around.
Are you that sure, just to know what you'll do
Life keeps on going and it's taking you right by its hand.
There are things, you can't understand.
Anyway, I'm doing alright with you.
Come talk to me, just touch my hand and let it now be really true.
Don't let fear conquer you.
Refrain
