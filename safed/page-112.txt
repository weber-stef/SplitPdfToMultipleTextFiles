MAN HURTING

There are too many people playing man hurting,
Too many a one who's trying to cheat you.
There are too many harms, that you don't realize,
There is many a wrong thing, that people do.
Refrain:
Too much, too much man hurting, man hurting.
Too much, too much man hurting, man hurting,
Too much, too much man hurting.
There are too many faces, that you can't see through.
There are too many wrong ones, that you trust.
But still you're ought to take every chance you get.
You either get lucky or get lost.
Refrain
