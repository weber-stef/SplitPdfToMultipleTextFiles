THE LOST AND THE LONELY

For she is not here, she has disappeared,
I'm just looking at, what is left of her.
I can't understand, the sense of an end,
leaving me like this, staying hopeless.

Bridge:
And everything left, like a lifeless wreck
seams to rest beside the lost and the lonely.

It's a different place, it's a different world,
It's a different life, slipping out my hands.
and the memory pushes me away,
seams to try to make everything else fade.

Bridge:
'Need to find, what's left, get my spirit back,
I can't rest beside the lost and the lonely.

Refrain:
Closer to admit existence can not be understood.
Every day that comes leaves you less time.
